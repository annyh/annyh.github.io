All were on the same site, <a href=\"https://poshmark.com/\">Poshmark</a>, a peer to peer fashion reselling platform. With my large closet choking with too many clothes, and realizing that I don’t wear 50% of what is in there, Poshmark seems the perfect place to sell. Perhaps I can recoup some, if not all of the money I’ve spent on it over the last three years?</p>\n<h3>The fashion reselling experiment</h3>\n<p>This is my second Poshmark sellilng experience. The <a href=\"https://poshmark.com/posh_guide/how_to_list_item\">selling process</a> is well documented so I won’t go into it here. The first time I’ve listed 20 items, mostly shoes. This time I have more to sell, so I listed 50 items, including shoes, blazers, and books. I spent one entire Saturday taking pictures under the natural light, and for each clothing item, taking multiple photos to show the measurements. My reasoning was, if I can de-risk my listing by providing measurements, perhaps the user would pay more for the item. To be on the safe side, I priced all my items around the lower range of existing listings, hoping for a quick sale on most items.</p>\n<h6>Saturday results</h6>\n<p>Unfortunately my hopes were dashed that same evening. The first offer was a lowball offer, offering me $10 for a <a href=\"https://poshmark.com/listing/Ted-Baker-size-2-wool-black-vest-5eacb169ac9702395aee955d\">wool Ted Baker vest</a> with a listing price of $30. For context, that vest has retail price of $200. I understand the concept of sunk cost, but the lowball sting hurt so much that I immediately countered to $25, $5 below the listing price. The potential buyer didn’t budge, so no sale on that vest for that day. </p>\n<p>Another offer came in for a pair of pilgrim <a href=\"https://poshmark.com/listing/John-fluevog-wingtips-175-heel-5eacd9343a0db9ad55a00931\">John Fluevog shoes</a>, retail price $200+. I’ve priced it at $75, a great deal considering the shoes have original soles and are barely worn. The offer was for $40 and I countered $50 without thinking. Eventually we settled for $45. $45 is an amazing steal for a pair of shoes from the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/fashion/john-fluevog-shoes.html\">famed Canadian shoe designer</a>.</p>\n<h6>Sunday results</h6>\n<p>For the rest of the evening and early Sunday I checked my phone frequently, hoping another offer or order would arrive. Nothing. I’ve uninstalled the Poshmark app to try to take my mind off it, then reinstalled it to lower the prices across all my listings, including halving the price of that Ted Baker vest from $30 to $15. Finally on Sunday afternoon an order came in. It was $15 for that barely worn Ted Baker vest. With that, I packaged up the shoes and the vest in separate cardboard boxes, saved from previous online purchases.</p>\n<h3>3 lessons I’ve learned on fashion reselling over the weekend</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Selling clothes is tough. It is tough because taking pictures and shipping and pricing is time intensive, plus the market is saturated with too many listings chasing too few eyeballs. Additionally <a href=\"https://support.poshmark.com/s/article/297755057?language=en_US\">Poshmark takes a fee: 20%</a> really cuts into the profit. <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/fees-credits-invoices/selling-fees?id=4364\">eBay reportedly takes 13%</a>, and I’ve cross-posted the higher end items there. No buyers yet.</li>\n<li>A smaller, decluttered closet is a happier closet, whereas a large, full walk-in closet is recipe for analysis paralysis. I’d rather have a smaller closet where the clothes are being worn in a monthly, if not weekly basis. It’s easier for outfit planning and easier on the wallet, because lower maintainance fees (think cleaning, repairs, storage, …)</li>\n<li>A better ban on clothing shopping is a revised <strong>one in, one out</strong> policy: only buy a piece of clothing when you have sold a piece of clothing. Sounds easy, and it is <em>way harder</em> than it sounds.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I use my <a href=\"https://shepicksuppennies.com/low-ball-poshmark-offers/\">Poshmark account to help declutter my closet</a>, not for any hope of making passive income, or recouping any of the hundreds, if not thousands of dollars I’ve spent on it over the years. I’ll hold myself to the <strong>one in, one out</strong> policy, and see if that naurally arrives at the same result as <a href=\"../shopping-ban\">the shopping ban</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My experience selling clothes on Poshmark over the weekend","date":"May 03, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/shopping-experience/","previous":{"html":"<p>I’ve been part of <a href=\"https://www.toastmasters.org\">Toastmasters</a> since January 2014. I was an intern and joined the club to get a job. Instead of getting a job, I got bitten by the public speaking bug. During my third internship I joined <a href=\"https://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club/01488281-salesforce-toastmasters\">Salesforce Toastmasters</a>. The Toastmasters club was one of the reasons I returned to <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com\">Salesforce</a> upon graduation, and I was an active member there for 5 years. Overall I’ve been a Toastmaster member for 7+ years and served as a past President and current Division Director. Here are three ways on how Toastmasters has benefited my career.</p>\n<h3>Seek speaking opportunities at work</h3>\n<p>An experienced Toastmater is a confident speaker with a vast repertoire of speaking experiences. He/she has spoken at various settings, whether that is MCing an online contest, facilitating a panel, or delivering a workshop. Having done all of the above at Toastmasters, I’m confident delivering an experience on front of hundreds of coworkers, whether that is facilitating a panel, MCing a hackathon, or grabbing a 30 minute coffee with a new colleague. How does Toastmasters help with grabbing coffee with someone!? First, you are speaking with another person, so it is public speaking. Second, standard Toastmaster meetings have a section of <a href=\"https://www.toastmasters.org/membership/club-meeting-roles/table-topics-speaker\">Table Topics</a>, where you ask questions to get another person to talk for 1 to 2 minutes. Grabbing coffee is one of the many ways I seek speaking opportunities at work, and having Toastmasters experience gives me a boost of confidence.</p>\n<h3>Craft, tailor, and refine your message</h3>\n<p>After netting a speaking opportunity, what do you say? <strong>Crafting</strong> the message, like any skill, gets better with more practice. My first speech took 12 hours of preparation, now my prep time is &#x3C; 1 hour on many occasions. The message also needs to be <strong>tailored</strong> to the audience: at Salesforce Toastmasters the audience hungered for my personal finance talks, since tech professionals are interested in accumulating wealth. During the Toastmaster’s competition season, the topic turns to self-development to appeal to a wider demographic. Additionally Toastmasters members give feedback on how to <strong>refine</strong> the mesasge. This includes feedback on content, ie. I’m notorious for having too much content, and also the delivery, ie. replace filler words (umms, so’s) with pauses. I make sure I get feedback on my speeches, especially the speeches for work, to improve my speaking skills.</p>\n<h3>Seek leadership experience at work</h3>\n<p>I sought leadership opportunities at Toastmasters to deliver amazing experiences by enlisting the most accomplished, motivated Toastmaster members to be part of my initiatives. Here’s a sample of initiatives I delivered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organized, staffed, and delivered 3 trainings in one month, resulting in ~120 Toastmasters officers trained</li>\n<li>Organized, staffed, and delivered 2 online contests, one with 70+ attendance</li>\n<li>Was accountable for 25 clubs spanning ~700 Toastmaster members, by working with 4 area directors, each covering 5 clubs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these experiences I’ve ran hackathons at work, and this week I’m moderating a panel of coworkers. Because working with good people and delivering rewarding experiences has an exponentail effect on everyone involved. I’ve gone from a shy intern seeking a job to a confident professional seeking opportunities to assemble teams to deliver wonderful experiences. Any team initative is also a speaking opportunity, where I practice crafting, tailoring, and refining a message. Hence Toastmasters is fully applicable, and a great testing ground for communication and leadership skills.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/toastmasters-experience/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I grew my career through Toastmasters"}},"next":{"html":"<p>I’m admist a self-imposed <a href=\"../shopping-ban\">shopping ban</a>. During this past month I’ve improved at controlling my spend. I haven’t bought any clothing online for almost two weeks, and don’t feel the urge to buy now. Here are 8 tips to curb online spending.</p>\n<h3>1. Find a new hobby</h3>\n<p>My former hobby was buying upscale clothing at a reasonable price. Over time, snapping up deals depleted my bank account and overflowed my closet. Eventually I realized my research skills could be put to better use. Nowadays I develop mobile apps as a hobby, because I know the importance of a good user interface in getting people to do what you want. I will blog more on my <a href=\"../quotes-app\">first Android app, created with react-native</a>.</p>\n<h3>2. Try selling the items</h3>\n<p><em>I can always resell it</em> was one of my favorite excuses to justify a new purchase. To experience reselling I’ve started <a href=\"../shopping-experience\">selling items on Poshmark</a>, and surprise surprise, clothes are way more <em>difficult to sell</em> than imagined. The many factors at play include the season, fit, trendiness, … Nevertheless selling clothes online is a new hobby of mine, because it is much more intellectually challenging and satisfying than buying.</p>\n<h3>3. Work on your body instead</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/587506-when-i-was-sixteen-i-had-just-two-things-on\">Warren Buffet said: if you only had one car, you’d baby that car. The same thing can be said about your body</a>. We each have only one body, it is the foundation of every outfit, so we need to take care of it! To stay fit while staying inside I’ve resorted to eating baby carrots (they are sweet and filling) and doing an hour of cardio each day including jumping jacks and pushups. I love exercising right after a meal because exercise necessitates smaller and healthier meals. If you want to look good in any outfit, work that bod!</p>\n<h3>4. Journal why you want to buy that item</h3>\n<p>Put the pen to paper and dig deep. For me, I digged trench coats with leather sleeves. Why? Because it stood out and exerted authority. Knowing that I want to stand out and exert authority, I amassed technical skills to stand out, and volunteered for leadership positions to gain authority. This exercise is very elucidating and can be more rewarding than shopping. It’s also free!</p>\n<h3>5. Realize the carrying cost of each item</h3>\n<p>Owning an item is not just coughing up the purchase price. Over the duration of ownership there’s cleaning cost, tailoring cost, mending cost, and selling/donation cost. With a large overflowing closet, the amount quickly adds up. Hence a small closet is good for your wallet.</p>\n<h3>6. Donate half of your closet</h3>\n<p>Take a large garbage bag and fill it with unworn clothes, donate it, then revel in the reclaimed spaciousness. Donating items is the fastest way to declutter, and decluttering feels great because it lifts weight from your closet, mind, and wallet (see previous point).</p>\n<h3>7. Prioritize buying other things</h3>\n<p>What can you do with $125 extra per month? Instead of shopping you can save for a trip, or buy other items such as books. $125 worth of books gives greater joy than most $125 worth of clothing, and books have lower carrying cost. They don’t need dry cleaning, and are easier to gift than clothes :)</p>\n<h3>Give these tips a try!</h3>\n<p>These are the tips I’m working with, and they are working. Now when I see a desirable item I examine <em>why the item appeals</em> to me, then <em>prioritize</em> the item amongst what to purchase. This means less purchases and a less cluttered mind and closet. Try these tips and they can work for you too!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/curb-online-spending/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"8 tips to curb spending"}}}}}
