The noontime sun bared down at us. We inched towards the Ferry building. </p>\n<p>At the building we got Japanese food: miso soup and curry beef. Yes we ate Asian food on America’s birthday; the city’s culinary options abound. On this day people crowded along the water. We ate on the benches with the dishes on our laps, our heads bent like monks in prayer.</p>\n<p>We headed towards Pier 39 along the Embarcadero street. A dozen nude male cyclists stood around the corner, sunbathing in helmets, shoes, and sunscreen. They smiled and basked in their sunlit glory. I ogled through my sunglasses, happy with the happenstance.</p>\n<p>Along the Embarcadero Harley Davidsons roared; black, orange, and green ones flew by. Their riders sat low; their hair floated like Beyonce’s.</p>\n<p>At Pier 39 the sea lions were missing. Boyfriend googled their whereabouts; during July they were away breeding. I miss their loud and smelly presence and yearn for their return.</p>\n<p>Throughout the afternoon we heard fireworks, and the drama intensified when the evening came. The fireworks streaked the sky, splattering yellow, green, and red on the dark canvas. We enjoyed the sights. Our furry friends lost the control over their bowels.</p>\n<p>T’was a glorious day in the city by the bay. </p>\n<p>Happy birthday America.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"July 4th in San Francisco","date":"July 06, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/july-fourth/","previous":{"html":"<p>I’ve been trading since 2013 and haven’t fallen for a scam yet. Here’s how I filter out the noise and find quality information on strategies on active trading.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Assume everything is a scam until it is proven otherwise</li>\n<li>There is no free information: be aware of how they are compensated</li>\n<li>When in doubt, google <em>Is XYZ a scam</em> and read the search results judiciously</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For trading tactics I avoid the <strong>trading forums</strong> and <strong>paid content</strong>. The trading forums are vaccum chambers where people shout out their trading position without the context of their strategy. The paid content, be it stock alerts or stock trading courses, is worse. They entice with sexy headlines such as “How to make a million in a month on the stock market”, then they promise to share information so you too will make money. There are 3 problems with that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You may not have enough money to trade using their stock picks or trading strategy</li>\n<li>Their trading strategy does not match with your personality type. For example my skeptical personality is incompatible with day trading </li>\n<li>Without a trading strategy, simply executing trades and hoping for a gain is a good way to burn real money. Do not follow someone’s advice on trading without understanding how that trade fits into their overall trading strategy, and test that strategy through paper trading before real trades</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What to do instead? For example if I’m curious regarding the tactic of <strong>trading options around earnings time</strong>, I search for those terms at <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/\">Fidelity</a> and Charles Schwab/<a href=\"https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/\">TD Ameritrade’s</a>. They make money through interests, trading fees, and asset management, so they don’t charge for tactics. Even then, test the tactics in a paper account first before trading real money. </p>","fields":{"slug":"/quality-content/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to avoid scams in stocks and options"}},"next":{"html":"<p>The San Francisco Metro Area is the <a href=\"https://www.zumper.com/blog/san-francisco-bay-area-metro-report/\">most expensive area to rent</a> in the entire USA. With a median rent of $3280, the area is so expensive that some <a href=\"https://www.zumper.com/blog/san-francisco-bay-area-metro-report/\">Google employees live in trailers</a>. Here are real stories I’ve heard from coworkers, friends, and acquaintances. This list is ranked from the funkiest to the most reasonable.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sleep on a futon</strong> for $800: a coworker of mine rented out his futon in the middle of the living room for $800/month. There was no privacy but it was a steal at 25% of the median rent</li>\n<li><strong>Sleep in a car</strong> for &#x3C; $1000/month: a friend from college lives in a car. He pays for a monthly parking permit and has factored in the cost of break-ins</li>\n<li>Live <strong>in a hostel</strong> for $1500: During my internship, I lived in a private room in a hostel that offered long term living arrangements. You get a private room but everything else is shared, including the bathroom and the kitchen</li>\n<li>Live <strong>in a boat</strong>: there’s the low budget boat, which an acquaintance paid &#x3C; $20,000 for but maintains every weekend, and then there’s a higher-end boat which two Directors at Salesforce live in. The pair plan to sail into the sunset once they’ve made a certain sum from Corporate America. I love this real-life romantic version of the American Dream :)</li>\n<li>Live with significant other in <strong>subsidized housing</strong> for $800: a coworker’s girlfriend works as an equestrian; they live in subsidized housing for $800, what a deal! Another person works at Google and lives with their boyfriend who is studying for his Ph.D. at Stanford</li>\n<li>Live in a house with <strong>5 other roommates</strong>: this is common in houses and high end apartments/condos. A couple may share a room while the rest of the twenty-something crew split the rest. The big limiting factor is the number of bathrooms; I’ve heard horror stories of 6 people living in a house with 1 bathroom</li>\n<li>Live <strong>in the living room</strong>: I know coworkers who live in the main room with a screen separating their space from the rest. When I brought up the prospect of living in one myself, a coworker asked: “What if you bringing someone back to the apartment?” I thought about it and didn’t pursue it</li>\n<li>Live in a <strong>300 square foot apartment</strong>: smaller spaces cost less and 300 sq ft is tiny; it barely fits a bed, a nightstand, and a bookcase. A coworker mentioned it forced her to be minimal since she cannot accumulate unwanted stuff. Space is a good forcing function; perhaps that’s why she arrived at the office early and left late</li>\n<li><strong>Move out of California</strong>: given the current epidemic many companies allow workers to work remotely, people move out of the expensive California state. Someone from Toastmasters moved to Oregon; they don’t have sales tax there. I too want to move but my significant other works in the autonomous vehicles industry, which is less remote-friendly</li>\n<li>Live <strong>with parents</strong>: some people get free rent, yet the only coworker who lived with her parents in SF moved out as soon as she got a full-time job. Perhaps the autonomy was worth the rent</li>\n</ol>\n<p>San Franscisco is a strange city where six-figure jobs are common but affordable housing is scarce. Getting a good deal on housing can feel like winning a lottery. Rent remains a significant chunk of most people’s after-tax income. This is food for thought if you ever considered moving into the San Francisco area.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/rent-hacks/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"10 rent hacks in San Francisco from coworkers and friends"}}}}}
