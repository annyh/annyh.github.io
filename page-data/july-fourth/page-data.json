The noontime sun bared down at us. We inched towards the Ferry building. </p>\n<p>At the building we got Japanese food: miso soup and curry beef. Yes we ate Asian food on America’s birthday; the city’s culinary options abound. On this day people crowded along the water. We ate on the benches with the dishes on our laps, our heads bent like monks in prayer.</p>\n<p>We headed towards Pier 39 along the Embarcadero street. A dozen nude male cyclists stood around the corner, sunbathing in helmets, shoes, and sunscreen. They smiled and basked in their sunlit glory. I ogled through my sunglasses, happy with the happenstance.</p>\n<p>Along the Embarcadero Harley Davidsons roared; black, orange, and green ones flew by. Their riders sat low; their hair floated like Beyonce’s.</p>\n<p>At Pier 39 the sea lions were missing. Boyfriend googled their whereabouts; during July they were away breeding. I miss their loud and smelly presence and yearn for their return.</p>\n<p>Throughout the afternoon we heard fireworks, and the drama intensified when the evening came. The fireworks streaked the sky, splattering yellow, green, and red on the dark canvas. We enjoyed the sights. Our furry friends lost the control over their bowels.</p>\n<p>T’was a glorious day in the city by the bay. </p>\n<p>Happy birthday America.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"July 4th in San Francisco","date":"July 06, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/july-fourth/","previous":{"html":"<p>I’ve been trading since 2013 and haven’t fallen for a scam yet. Here’s how I filter out the noise and find quality information on strategies on active trading.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Assume everything is a scam until it is proven otherwise</li>\n<li>There is no free information: be aware of how they are compensated</li>\n<li>When in doubt, google <em>Is XYZ a scam</em> and read the search results judiciously</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For trading tactics I avoid the <strong>trading forums</strong> and <strong>paid content</strong>. The trading forums are vaccum chambers where people shout out their trading position without the context of their strategy. The paid content, be it stock alerts or stock trading courses, is worse. They entice with sexy headlines such as “How to make a million in a month on the stock market”, then they promise to share information so you too will make money. There are 3 problems with that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You may not have enough money to trade using their stock picks or trading strategy</li>\n<li>Their trading strategy does not match with your personality type. For example my skeptical personality is incompatible with day trading </li>\n<li>Without a trading strategy, simply executing trades and hoping for a gain is a good way to burn real money. Do not follow someone’s advice on trading without understanding how that trade fits into their overall trading strategy, and test that strategy through paper trading before real trades</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What to do instead? For example if I’m curious regarding the tactic of <strong>trading options around earnings time</strong>, I search for those terms at <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/\">Fidelity</a> and Charles Schwab/<a href=\"https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/\">TD Ameritrade’s</a>. They make money through interests, trading fees, and asset management, so they don’t charge for tactics. Even then, test the tactics in a paper account first before trading real money. </p>","fields":{"slug":"/quality-content/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to avoid scams in stocks and options"}},"next":null}}}
