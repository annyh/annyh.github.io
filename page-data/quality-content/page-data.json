Here’s how I filter out the noise and find quality information on strategies on active trading.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Assume everything is a scam until it is proven otherwise</li>\n<li>There is no free information: be aware of how they are compensated</li>\n<li>When in doubt, google <em>Is XYZ a scam</em> and read the search results judiciously</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For trading tactics I avoid the <strong>trading forums</strong> and <strong>paid content</strong>. The trading forums are vaccum chambers where people shout out their trading position without the context of their strategy. The paid content, be it stock alerts or stock trading courses, is worse. They entice with sexy headlines such as “How to make a million in a month on the stock market”, then they promise to share information so you too will make money. There are 3 problems with that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You may not have enough money to trade using their stock picks or trading strategy</li>\n<li>Their trading strategy does not match with your personality type. For example my skeptical personality is incompatible with day trading </li>\n<li>Without a trading strategy, simply executing trades and hoping for a gain is a good way to burn real money. Do not follow someone’s advice on trading without understanding how that trade fits into their overall trading strategy, and test that strategy through paper trading before real trades</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What to do instead? For example if I’m curious regarding the tactic of <strong>trading options around earnings time</strong>, I search for those terms at <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/\">Fidelity</a> and Charles Schwab/<a href=\"https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/\">TD Ameritrade’s</a>. They make money through interests, trading fees, and asset management, so they don’t charge for tactics. Even then, test the tactics in a paper account first before trading real money. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to avoid scams in stocks and options","date":"July 05, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/quality-content/","previous":{"html":"<p>Active trading has a bad reputation lately. Why not just buy an index fund and forget it? Even <a href=\"https://lifestyletrading101.com/warren-buffetts-best-investment-advice-buy-index-funds/?\">Warren Buffet advocates the S&#x26;P500 index for most people</a>.</p>\n<h3>What I learned from a good investment advisor</h3>\n<p>When I was a university student in Canada in 2013 I bought a mutual fund mirroring the predominant Canadian index, hoping for the often-promised <a href=\"https://www.thesimpledollar.com/investing/stocks/where-does-7-come-from-when-it-comes-to-long-term-stock-returns/\">7% average gain</a>. When I checked 1.5 years later the gain was only 2%. </p>\n<p>“What happened? Why are the gains so low?” I asked the investment advisor. I was still in university, and what she said stuck with me, after I’ve forgotten most of the finance class.</p>\n<p>“You bought high in the 52 week range”, she said. The relatively stable Canadian stock market didn’t rally much because it is mostly energy and finance sectors. “There are other mutual funds with more aggressive growth, would you like to see?”   </p>\n<p>“Yes!” I said. She showed me a mutual fund that instead of the 2% gain, had posted <em>45% gains</em> in the last year. “What is in <em>that mutual fund?</em>”</p>\n<p>She showed me the prospectus. It had 50%+ concentration in US stocks. Furthermore the fund has benefited from the USD’s appreciation against the Canadian dollar.</p>\n<p>I was dumbfounded. First, I was thrilled with the great wealth of information available publicly on the Internet, that I can tap into to make better investment decisions. Second, I was slighly peeved that this was not covered in the Introduction to Finance class. Instead of continuing with the passive fund,  I sold and began to teach myself how to actively trade. I still buy and sell index funds opportunistically: when the stock market goes up the indexes go up; when the market is down buy something to profit from the upswing.</p>\n<h3>The goal is to actively trade stocks and options to:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Make money when the market goes sideways, then the funds barely move</li>\n<li>Hedge the concentrated positions </li>\n<li>Generate a bit of income, preferably 15%+ annually</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Why 15%?</em> Because I need to have a threshold to place my trades, and if I can achieve 15% annual growth that means <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/rule72.htm\">doubling the money</a> every 5 years, instead of the 10 years with the average 7% stock market returns.  </p>\n<h3>How I haven’t blown up my bank account (yet)</h3>\n<p>As a business student turned engineer I set some parameters for myself. After all, Warren Buffet said the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffetts-investing-rule-no-154251030.html\">#1 investing rule is: never lose money</a>. To this end I:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Trade infrequently: no day trading </li>\n<li>Journal every entry: what’s the rationale behind the trade? Ie. did I buy for potential capital gains, or is it mostly a dividend play? Is it a long term position or a short term one? What’s the exit and the <a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/stop-loss-order/\">stop loss</a>? </li>\n<li>Aim to buy quality stocks on sale: use limit orders to buy S&#x26;P 500 companies around price supports, preferably around their 52 week low </li>\n<li>Stick to what I’ve tested out on paper trade: sell naked puts, and maybe covered calls</li>\n<li>Focus on tax efficiency: moved most of my money into tax advantaged or tax deferred accounts</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In 2020 in 2 weeks I’ve made $10k paper trading options which is 5% of the paper trade portfolio, and since March I’ve made 20% in real money with a mutual fund tracking the Nasdaq index. I chose Nasdaq because it contains the biggest names in tech, and the work from home phenomenom benefits them.</p>\n<h3>Investing as a potential revenue stream</h3>\n<p>I am fortunate that I have an engineering job with a good salary, however no job is permanent. I am building out this skill set in my twenties to develop a revenue stream that hopefully will support my frugal lifestyle.</p>\n<p><strong>Next steps: learn more about</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Trading USD/CAD pair on forex</li>\n<li>Bonds: when to buy?</li>\n<li>Futures, especially how to provide downside protection when the market goes bonkers?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I love learning the fundamentals via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_simulator\">paper trading</a>, then applying them in real life. </p>\n<p>Looking forward to more investing adventures.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/active-trading/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why I actively trade in the stock market"}},"next":{"html":"<p>America’s birthday was a sunny day in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>Boyfriend and I came out of our apartment by the bay, our empty stomachs grumbling. The noontime sun bared down at us. We inched towards the Ferry building. </p>\n<p>At the building we got Japanese food: miso soup and curry beef. Yes we ate Asian food on America’s birthday; the city’s culinary options abound. On this day people crowded along the water. We ate on the benches with the dishes on our laps, our heads bent like monks in prayer.</p>\n<p>We headed towards Pier 39 along the Embarcadero street. A dozen nude male cyclists stood around the corner, sunbathing in helmets, shoes, and sunscreen. They smiled and basked in their sunlit glory. I ogled through my sunglasses, happy with the happenstance.</p>\n<p>Along the Embarcadero Harley Davidsons roared; black, orange, and green ones flew by. Their riders sat low; their hair floated like Beyonce’s.</p>\n<p>At Pier 39 the sea lions were missing. Boyfriend googled their whereabouts; during July they were away breeding. I miss their loud and smelly presence and yearn for their return.</p>\n<p>Throughout the afternoon we heard fireworks, and the drama intensified when the evening came. The fireworks streaked the sky, splattering yellow, green, and red on the dark canvas. We enjoyed the sights. Our furry friends lost the control over their bowels.</p>\n<p>T’was a glorious day in the city by the bay. </p>\n<p>Happy birthday America.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/july-fourth/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"July 4th in San Francisco"}}}}}
