I’ve also traded stock options. For each stock I had a entry point, and exit point, and plans for when the trade went south. I wrote this to remind myself the of the truths of stock-picking, and what makes it fun and dangerous.</p>\n<h2>The ugly truths of stock-picking:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Having a job with stock compensation is a surer way to wealth than trading full time</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I work in tech and pick stocks to diversify away from tech. In addition to providing an income the job provides a 401(k) which allow gains to grow tax-free. Working also limits overtrading, which hurts returns.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Investing and trading is not entertainment</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Only on reddit do writers spew: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lsq77k/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_5/\">“diamond handed apes riding whales screaming war cries in their final push before entering the gates of Valhalla”</a>. While reddit is entertaining, blindly following someone’s tips is a sure way to lose money. Reading reddit is a fun way to get trade ideas, and after research most ideas don’t check out.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>It’s easier to grow and/or destroy smaller accounts</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Articles titled <a href=\"https://financialpost.com/investing/robinhood-investors-top-picks-blowing-away-hedge-funds-market\">“Robinhood investors’ top picks are blowing away hedge funds”</a> make the ordinary sound extraordinary. <a href=\"https://www.brokerage-review.com/investing-firm/assets-under-management/robinhood-aum.aspx\">The average account size in Robinhood is only $1,500</a>, while <a href=\"https://thehedgefundjournal.com/what-lies-beneath/\">a medium sized hedge fund manages billions</a>. It’s easy to double a molehill but not a mountain. The inverse is also true; it’s easy to destroy a molehill, but not a mountain.</p>\n<h2>Fun highlights I’ve experienced in stock-picking:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy and hold can double your money</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I bought Disney(<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DIS/\">DIS</a>), Apple(<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/\">AAPL</a>), and Home Depot(<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HD\">HD</a>) back in 2019, when the threat of Chinese tariffs and the popularity of Netflix rattled these stocks. Now in 2021 Apple almost quadrupled while both Disney and Home Depot doubled: thanks to COVID these companies grew bigger. This is an example of how <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/letyourprofitrun.asp.\">“let your profits run”</a> can yield impressive returns.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Intra-day trading can double your money</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At the tail end of the GameStop(<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME\">GME</a>) craze, when the stock dropped from $80 to $60 in February 2021, a put for $30 strike price expiring that week grew from $2 to $3 in one day. Buying and selling that would have netted 50% return in less than 8 hours. </p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The underlying stock matters</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I have short-term positions on GameStop to take adantage of volatility, but not on HD or Apple or Disney. Each stock is different and requires following.</p>\n<h2>How to lose money via stock-picking</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Selling options and overtrading </li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://ragingbull.com/options-profit-planner/how-to-guarantee-income-like-the-casinos-do/\">Option education courses say selling options is like operating a casino</a>; you make a little money on each transaction, so to make more money, make more transactions. I disagree; the only casino in the investing/trading game are the brokerage houses and the clearing houses; they make money on volume while the retail traders lose money from locking in losses. </p>\n<p>There is also the opportunity cost: I’ve lost out on returns by <a href=\"/favorite-option-strategy/\">selling cash-covered puts</a> during the bull market of April and May 2020, and also by selling covered calls on Salesforce(<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRM\">CRM</a>) and Nvidia(<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA\">NVDA</a>), when their prices peaked.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Following someone’s stock tips blindly</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When a course/chart/person promises to predict the future, run. No one knows the future. The experienced investors have a plan of what to do when a trade goes south, and when to take the winnings off of the table, but they know about the future as much as a beginner does.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Too many stocks</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/now/charlie-munger-on-value-investing-and-the-crisis-in-wealth-management-114327424.html\">Charlie Munger, Warren Buffe’ts business partner, said: “It’s ‘absolute insanity’ to think owning 100 stocks instead of five makes you a better investor”</a>. Doing due diligence is costly. Filtering out trade ideas takes time, and each position requires baby-sitting, especially for short-term positions for volatility play. Volatility is like fire; it can increase returns, but it can also burn down the portfolio.</p>\n<h2>Given the bad news, how to be a good investor?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Avoid overtrading</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There’s a research and monitoring cost per trade, which makes stock-picking expensive. Long-term holds require less monitoring but when their price drops significantly I still look into it. Perhaps the best antidote to overtrading is not to trade at all; <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/success/ct-biz-warren-buffett-index-funds-dollarsense-20190305-story.html\">Warren Buffet, the famed investor, advises against stock-picking</a>, and I agree with him; it’s the best alternative for the majority.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Have a hypotheses per position and do scenario planning</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Research is the most time-consuming part of stock-picking; having a hypothesis directs the research. For example when selling puts I expect a stock to stay above a price point by a certain date. To determine the price point I read the news, look at historical performance, and compare with peers. </p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Compete against self, not S&#x26;P 500 or an arbitrary target</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Goals on how much to generate, eg. generate 2% returns montly for a $20,000 account, are detrimental to long-term growth because they focus on short-term gains and ignore the context. Last year I was able to double an accounts; this year I don’t expect the same performance since the COVID impacted stock already turned around. I still look for stocks that are temporarily hampered, with long term growth potential.</p>\n<p>There you go, the truth, the fun, and the dangerous. Keep the day job and have fun learning about individual stocks, or go with an index fund and skip stock-picking altogether. The stock market is supposed to be boring and profitable, not a source of entertainment. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ugly truths in stock-picking","date":"February 27, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ugly-investing/","previous":{"html":"<p>My first options trade was selling a put; since then I’ve experimented with other strategies. Reflecting on the trades over the past year, I noticed when selling puts shined, and when it did not.</p>\n<h2>How I started trading options</h2>\n<p>April 2020 was a great time for options traders: quality companies were on a Covid-induced selloff, and volatility was high so puts were highly-priced. Selling a put is similar to selling insurance; you get paid for potentially buying the stock at the strike price.</p>\n<p>One of my trades was <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPG?p=SPG\">Simon Property Group (SPG)</a> back in May 2020. <a href=\"./invest-15000\">I wrote how I chose SPG here</a>; it was a quality stock I wanted to own. I received a $5 monthly premium at the $60 strike price, to potentially buy shares at $60. Annualized returns for the monthly contract was 84%<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>, much more attractive than the &#x3C;2% in a savings account. I sold puts on SPG multiple times to generate income.</p>\n<p>Almost a year later I <a href=\"./gme-week\">sold puts on GameStop</a> to profit from high volatility. I did not want to own GameStop so the trade was more unnerving.</p>\n<p>While collecting premium is nice, selling puts can also be used to acquire stocks at a discount. </p>\n<h2>Is selling puts the best way to acquire stock?</h2>\n<p>Conventional wisdom says <a href=\"https://www.learningmarkets.com/buying-stocks-at-a-discount-by-selling-put-options/\">selling puts on stocks you want to own</a> is a good way to acquire them. My experience was the opposite; in a bull market, selling puts underperformed both holding the stock and buying calls. I know because I tried all three tactics; as the stock market rebounded in 2020 after the march selloff, getting assigned (ie. buy the stock on options expiry) was a challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Buying the stock</strong> outright uses less money than selling puts, since cash-secured puts use 120% of the stock price. For example, I bought a mutual fund similar to <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QQQ/\">QQQ</a> instead of selling puts on QQQ, and the mutual fund performed +60% in one year. It’s proof that <em>in trading, simple techniques can beat complicated setups</em>.</p>\n<p>Instead of buy-and-hold, for <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/jwn\">Nordstrom (JWN)</a> in October 2020 I <strong>bought a call</strong> expiring in January 2021. I expected the stock to rise above the $13 strike price. It was my first time buying a call so I bought one contract to wait three months. The benefit was clear; for $2.5 premium I controlled 100 shares and used $250 instead of $1100<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>It could have been my most profitable trade: during January 2021 JWN’s price rose to $38 and each contract was worth 100 x ($38 - $13)= $2,600, over 10 times the premium. Too bad I already closed the trade at 100% profit. I wish I bought more contracts and waited more, but hindsight is 20/20.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I started trading options by selling puts. Selling puts is best for generating income during high volatility, however during bull markets it’s best to buy-and-hold or buy calls.</p>\n<p>2020 was a bullish year. I look forward to learn more about options in 2021.</p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> 365 / 30 * 5 / ( 60 * 1.2) = 84%</p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> $11 was Nordstrom’s stock price in October 2020    </p>","fields":{"slug":"/favorite-option-strategy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My favorite options strategy"}},"next":{"html":"<p>I stumbled across <a href=\"https://jessicaabel.com/about/\">Jessica Abel</a> because of <a href=\"https://jessicaabel.com/idea-debt/\">Idea Debt</a>, a concept for creative sunk costs, and found she is also an accomplished comics artist and author with <a href=\"https://jessicaabel.com/books/\">multiple published titles</a>. As someone who tried to create graphic novels twice, I knew intimately how challenging that was, so I was curious how she was able to pull off the workload while working as a faculty at a university.</p>\n<p>I tried out her tried-and-true <a href=\"https://jessicaabel.lpages.co/creative-engine-masterclass/\">Creative Engine Masterclass</a> to create more comics, and the process worked! The most powerful part of her one-hour class is when she mentioned how artists <strong>gain confidence by iterating: the more iterations through the 4 phases, the more reflection, and the better the Engine works.</strong> </p>\n<p>It makes sense: <em>the best defense against doubt is reminding it you’ve created art recently, and you can do it again.</em></p>\n<p>Abel stresses there are four phases in the Creative Engine, and to not skip any phase. By taking these tips and focusing on iterating, I went from drawing 4 comics in 1 day and burning out, to drawing 8 comics 1 day, 4 the next day, and 8 comics again on the third day. In three days I’ve iterated through the phases five times and <em>created as many comics as last year!</em></p>\n<p>By following her framework I can sustainably average 2 comics/day, including breaks. This means almost 720 comics a year, a HUGE confidence boost. <em>I’ll have enough comics to fill a few books!</em></p>\n<h2>Abel’s 4 phases applied to my comic-creation process:</h2>\n<h3>Collect</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Journal comic ideas</li>\n<li>Type up the promising ones</li>\n<li>Edit the typed list: Add notes about layout ie. 3 rows or 3 columns, 4 panels, …</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Decide</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Review the list of bolded items, edit any layouts/visual cues</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Act</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Find pictures to base drawings off of. Usually use Google to find reference drawings</li>\n<li>Draw/reuse a drawing in a sketchbook with a pencil and pen. I tried drawing digitally; so far it’s faster to draw on paper and make minor edits with a mouse</li>\n<li>Scan the drawings and edit text and layout in Photoshop</li>\n<li>Backup to the cloud</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Reflect</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Journal what went well and what could be improved</li>\n<li>Post on my website and social media (ie. Reddit). This is done weekly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Wins</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>I learned the ideal batch size is 4: I can produce 4 comics at a time without burning out, and finish the iteration (from <strong>Decide</strong> to <strong>Reflect</strong>) within 2 hours</li>\n<li>Since the focus is on faster iterations, I simplified my drawing style and decreased the time to find reference photos. Yay!</li>\n<li>Drawing twice a day satisfies my urge to draw. Each drawing session lasts around 45 minutes to 1 hour</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What slows me down</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Running out of ideas during the <strong>Decide</strong> phase, then going back to the collect phase to generate more comic ideas. Some ideas are tossed out because of an unclear punchline, or unclear visual representation</li>\n<li>Adding more drawings after the initial scan. It adds another draw-scan-edit cycle</li>\n<li>Taking long breaks: When a break is 20+ minutes long it’s challenging to get back into the flow</li>\n<li>Checking email/social media during an iteration</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What works</h2>\n<p><strong>The #1 determinant of how many comics I produce is a quality idea list</strong>. Ideally, it has 2+ batches of ready-to-go ideas before I go into the <strong>Decision</strong> phase. If the list is shorter I fear running out of ideas and feel less confident.</p>\n<p>I prefer to work on fresh ideas ie. ideas that are at most one week old. Perhaps I second-guess older ideas.</p>\n<p>For posting to get feedback, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/\">r/writing</a> is very responsive to comics about questions. The subreddit is also underserved by comics since most posts are text. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/\">r/programmerhumor</a> has a larger and opinionated audience.</p>\n<p>Posting on Mondays gets the most traffic, but posting multiple times a week is better than not posting for months because of feedback.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I’m a more confident comics artist, after adapting Jessica Abel’s 4 phase Creative Engine to my comic creation process. It feels good to have a list of new comics to post on social media and blog. My comics <a href=\"https://www.annyhe.com/\">are here</a>.</p>\n<p>My next steps are to create more comic ideas and to go through another 5 iterations. I’ll write up the findings in another post.</p>\n<p>Here is Jessica Abel’s super valuable one-hour <a href=\"https://jessicaabel.lpages.co/creative-engine-masterclass/\">Masterclass on the Creative Engine</a>, and <a href=\"https://jessicaabel.com/blog/\">her blog</a> details more ways to increase the creative output.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/creative-process/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to gain artistic confidence"}}}}}
