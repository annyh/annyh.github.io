Here’s what I wish I knew at the beginning of my software engineering journey.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How to <strong>get promoted</strong>: be proactive and figure out what to work on. It also helps to mentor newer engineers, write technical documents, and drive high-profile projects. Clarify which projects to deliver with your manager, set a target date, then follow up on the plan every two weeks.</li>\n<li>Promotion is <em>partially</em> based on merit, and not all work is promote-able. Do not use promotion as a barometer of your progress. You can develop skills outside of work and interview to get a better offer elsewhere.</li>\n<li>There are two ways to view <strong>compensation</strong>. The half-empty view says engineers are undervalued for building scalable products, while the half-full view says we are being compensated to <em>learn</em>, while the learnings translate to the bottom line. Both are true.</li>\n<li><strong>Cultivating a network</strong> is just as important as the actual work. It’s heartwarming to hear from my former colleagues mention the <a href=\"https://github.com/salesforce/refocus\">monitoring project I worked on</a> is still maintained. Who knows, I might end up back at Salesforce someday.</li>\n<li><strong>Open source projects</strong> take a ton of community building to get contributors. Building a community is not a side-gig for a single engineer. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@annyhe\">I know, I tried</a>.</li>\n<li>There is no work-life balance, only <strong>tradeoffs</strong>. Remember technology is the means to an end, both for you as a software engineer, and for the company. </li>\n<li>Most engineers do not <strong>get wealthy</strong> by working for someone else. If the company IPOs and you have a significant stake, you might become a millionaire. It’s like winning the lottery; don’t bank on it.</li>\n<li><strong>Women engineers</strong> exist but <a href=\"https://www.universityaffairs.ca/features/feature-article/the-engineering-gender-gap-its-more-than-a-numbers-game/#:~:text=U.S.%20numbers%20suggest%2040%20percent,Jones.\">our ranks peaked around 1985</a>. I’ve done my share of interviewing interns; we have an equal number of men and women at that level. Yet women are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2020/jan/02/ten-years-on-why-are-there-still-so-few-women-in-tech\">45% more likely than men to drop out of engineering</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizelting/2019/08/21/why-women-quit/?sh=69ded56b16fa\">structural problems causing attrition</a> are too many to list here. The good news? The women engineers’ community is tight and supportive. When I find another female engineer in a sea of men, it’s like finding a unicorn.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Overall it’s been an amazing 8 years: I’ve worked in five different companies, moved from Vancouver to San Francisco, and worked with amazing people across the world.</p>\n<p>Here’s to another 8 years of learning.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What I wish I knew as a software engineer","date":"June 17, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/wiwik/","previous":{"html":"<p>I stumbled across <a href=\"https://jessicaabel.com/about/\">Jessica Abel</a> because of <a href=\"https://jessicaabel.com/idea-debt/\">Idea Debt</a>, a concept for creative sunk costs, and found she is also an accomplished comics artist and author with <a href=\"https://jessicaabel.com/books/\">multiple published titles</a>. As someone who tried to create graphic novels twice, I knew intimately how challenging that was, so I was curious how she was able to pull off the workload while working as a faculty at a university.</p>\n<p>I tried out her tried-and-true <a href=\"https://jessicaabel.lpages.co/creative-engine-masterclass/\">Creative Engine Masterclass</a> to create more comics, and the process worked! The most powerful part of her one-hour class is when she mentioned how artists <strong>gain confidence by iterating: the more iterations through the 4 phases, the more reflection, and the better the Engine works.</strong> </p>\n<p>It makes sense: <em>the best defense against doubt is reminding it you’ve created art recently, and you can do it again.</em></p>\n<p>Abel stresses there are four phases in the Creative Engine, and to not skip any phase. By taking these tips and focusing on iterating, I went from drawing 4 comics in 1 day and burning out, to drawing 8 comics 1 day, 4 the next day, and 8 comics again on the third day. In three days I’ve iterated through the phases five times and <em>created half as many comics as last year!</em></p>\n<p>By following her framework I can sustainably average 2 comics/day, including breaks. This means almost 720 comics a year, a HUGE confidence boost. <em>I’ll have enough comics to fill a few books!</em></p>\n<h2>Abel’s 4 phases applied to my comic-creation process:</h2>\n<h3>Collect</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Journal comic ideas</li>\n<li>Type up the promising ones</li>\n<li>Edit the typed list: Add notes about layout ie. 3 rows or 3 columns, 4 panels, …</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Decide</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Review the list of bolded items, edit any layouts/visual cues</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Act</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Find pictures to base drawings off of. Usually use Google to find reference drawings</li>\n<li>Draw/reuse a drawing in a sketchbook with a pencil and pen. I tried drawing digitally; so far it’s faster to draw on paper and make minor edits with a mouse</li>\n<li>Scan the drawings and edit text and layout in Photoshop</li>\n<li>Backup to the cloud</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Reflect</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Journal what went well and what could be improved</li>\n<li>Post on my website and social media (ie. Reddit). This is done weekly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Wins</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>I learned the ideal batch size is 4: I can produce 4 comics at a time without burning out, and finish the iteration (from <strong>Decide</strong> to <strong>Reflect</strong>) within 2 hours</li>\n<li>Since the focus is on faster iterations, I simplified my drawing style and decreased the time to find reference photos. Yay!</li>\n<li>Drawing twice a day satisfies my urge to draw. Each drawing session lasts around 45 minutes to 1 hour</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What slows me down</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Running out of ideas during the <strong>Decide</strong> phase, then going back to the collect phase to generate more comic ideas. Some ideas are tossed out because of an unclear punchline, or unclear visual representation</li>\n<li>Adding more drawings after the initial scan. It adds another draw-scan-edit cycle</li>\n<li>Taking long breaks: When a break is 20+ minutes long it’s challenging to get back into the flow</li>\n<li>Checking email/social media during an iteration</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What works</h2>\n<p><strong>The #1 determinant of how many comics I produce is a quality idea list</strong>. Ideally, it has 2+ batches of ready-to-go ideas before I go into the <strong>Decision</strong> phase. If the list is shorter I fear running out of ideas and feel less confident.</p>\n<p>I prefer to work on fresh ideas ie. ideas that are at most one week old. Perhaps I second-guess older ideas.</p>\n<p>For posting to get feedback, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/\">r/writing</a> is very responsive to comics about questions. The subreddit is also underserved by comics since most posts are text. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/\">r/programmerhumor</a> has a larger and opinionated audience.</p>\n<p>Posting on Mondays gets the most traffic, but posting multiple times a week is better than not posting for months because of feedback.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I’m a more confident comics artist, after adapting Jessica Abel’s 4 phase Creative Engine to my comic creation process. It feels good to have a list of new comics to post on social media and blog. My comics <a href=\"https://www.annyhe.com/\">are here</a>.</p>\n<p>My next steps are to create more comic ideas and to go through another 5 iterations. I’ll write up the findings in another post.</p>\n<p>Here is Jessica Abel’s super valuable one-hour <a href=\"https://jessicaabel.lpages.co/creative-engine-masterclass/\">Masterclass on the Creative Engine</a>, and <a href=\"https://jessicaabel.com/blog/\">her blog</a> details more ways to increase the creative output.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/creative-process/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to gain artistic confidence"}},"next":{"html":"<p>During this last year, I spent much time indoors pondering what matters to me. Life happened despite the pandemic: I traveled and changed jobs as planned. I looked for a set of values behind these decisions to apply for future decision-making. Here’s what I came up with. </p>\n<h2>My values are:</h2>\n<p>Simplicity, Creativity, and Optimize for long-term happiness.</p>\n<h2>Why values matter</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>To provide a framework for <strong>decision-making</strong>: It’s good to have long-term criteria to base the decisions on</li>\n<li>For <strong>protection</strong>: everyone’s value is different and what feels right to others might feel wrong to you. Knowing your values helps to detect and avoid incompatible values.</li>\n<li>For <strong>happiness</strong>: working on what matters will make you happier. Dopamine, a happiness chemical, is <a href=\"https://www.edutopia.org/blog/neurologist-makes-case-video-game-model-learning-tool\">released on incremental progress</a>. It’s 100% legal and free.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How I came up with my values</h2>\n<p>I asked myself these questions:</p>\n<h3>1. What do I need the most in my life?</h3>\n<p>I need <strong>simplicity</strong>. My interests include <a href=\"../ugly-investing\">trading stocks</a> and starting a business, and both deal with complex systems. My job as a software engineer tackles complexity with complexity. I need simplicity to make sense of the world, and to reduce the cognitive load. This means renting instead of buying a house, making fewer trades on the stock market, and making sense of the world by creating.</p>\n<h3>2. Consume vs create</h3>\n<p>I’m a creative person: creating something, even jotting down thoughts, is an enjoyable activity. Consuming too much media, on the other hand, is draining. I consume content from a select few writers and artists. To avoid binging content, I create my own. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, after all.</p>\n<h3>3. Which type of happiness to optimize for</h3>\n<p>There are two types of happiness: <a href=\"https://www.trackinghappiness.com/short-term-long-term-happiness/\">long-term and short-term</a>. Short-term happiness leads to consumerism: eating a lot, drinking a lot, smoking whatnot. It includes buying unnecessary products: <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/retail-therapy-shopping-compulsion/\">retail therapy works</a>, but only short-term.</p>\n<p>Long-term happiness deals with <a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/delayed-gratification-why-wait-for-what-you-want-2795429\">delayed gratification</a>. It’s about minimizing the paycheque while maximizing the retirement account contributions, going to bed early instead of binge-watching YouTube, and exercising instead of window-shopping. It’s about working on personal projects at 6 am and 7 pm instead of binging content. I choose it because the payoff is greater.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Thanks to the pandemic I’ve had time to mull over major decisions. Three values stood out: simplicity, creativity, and long-term happiness. I use them daily for prioritization and planning.</p>\n<p>What are your top three values? And how are you living them?</p>","fields":{"slug":"/my_values/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My top 3 values"}}}}}
