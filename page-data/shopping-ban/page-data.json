Thanks to sites like <a href=\"https://www.thredup.com/\">thredup</a>, <a href=\"https://poshmark.com\">poshmark</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/\">eBay</a>, I spent countless hours browsing online, resulting in overflowing closets, mindless spending, and less savings. Why is less savings troubling? A dollar invested today, assuming a 7% growth rate, <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/rule72.htm\">will double in 10 years</a>.\nInspired by the <a href=\"https://caitflanders.com/shopping-ban/\">shopping ban by Cate Flanders</a>, I designed a shopping ban for myself, with custom rules.</p>\n<h3>The Rules</h3>\n<p>For simplicity there are two buckets of spending: one is banned, another not banned.</p>\n<h5>Banned categories:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>clothing</strong>: it feels bad spending good money on emotional purchases, meaning purchases made when I felt lonely, homesick, or bored. Instead of shopping for clothes I will call my parents and forge stronger relationships. Additionally I will use the saved time to develop programming and drawing skills, and investing knowledge</li>\n<li><strong>art supplies</strong>: After a buying-spree on colored markers, I’m good for a few years</li>\n<li><strong>online courses</strong>: I’ve considered paying for <a href=\"https://www.skillshare.com\">Skillshare</a> for drawing courses and <a href=\"https://www.pluralsight.com/\">Pluralsight</a> for technical knowledge, however their free content is sufficient. I use <a href=\"https://sfpl.org/research-learn/elearning\">LinkedIn Learning, it is free with my library membership</a>; LinkedIn Learning has good courses on technology and personal finance. Additionally I already have an annual subscription for <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/\">DataCamp</a>, and they specialize in Python and Data Science. </li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Categories outside the ban:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>food</strong>: my monthly expenditure is already low</li>\n<li><strong>travel</strong>: my budget is already &#x3C; $1000/year</li>\n<li><strong>books</strong>: I have a soft spot for buying used books. I read 80% of the books I buy, and on average they cost &#x3C; $10 each</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking forward to a year of less spending, less clutter, and more savings!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Year-long Shopping ban, from 4/2020 to 4/2021","date":"April 20, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/shopping-ban/","previous":{"html":"<p>In the spirit of learning what’s new and latest in the world of two-sided markets, I explored online platforms that connect employers and software engineers. Hiring platforms such as <a href=\"https://hired.com\">Hired</a> and <a href=\"https://triplebyte.com/candidates\">TripleByte</a> all tackle the problem differently. Furthermore it’s also good to practice coding questions on <a href=\"https://leetcode.com\">LeetCode</a>. Here’s some lowlights and highlights of my exploration on LeetCode, Hired and a short fling with TripleByte.</p>\n<h1>Experiences</h1>\n<p>The most annoying thing: each online job seeker platform have a lengthy separate setup time and upkeep: Hired requires vigilant upkeep to accept interview invites, and Triplebyte demands answering a quiz plus additional programming excises. These are taxing on the job seeker, who, if living in the Bay Area and is well-connected, already has many other recruiters sending phone requests to in their inbox.</p>\n<p><strong>Hired</strong></p>\n<p>There is little differentiation between companies when they hire through a platform: any posting looking for a software engineer of a certain domain asks for a similar set of technologies, hence all the companies look similar.\nThe companies I interviewed with on Hired are venture-funded startups, and while I enjoyed interviewing with them and received offers, I turned them down to take a different position within Salesforce, my then-employer.\nInitial non-technical phone screens were time intensive, and it’s not really clear what is the value-add to the job seeker.\nTake home exercises weeds out candidates who don’t do free exercise, or who are interviewing with multiple companies. You can read about <a href=\"../Why-I-refuse-to-do-take-home-programming-assignments-for-programming-interviews/\">my stance in take-home exercises here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>TripleByte</strong></p>\n<p>The major selling point of this platform is the job seeker goes directly to tech screens with the companies, skipping the non-technical initial call. Before all that, the job seeker has to clear a programming exercise, then a programming interview with TripleByte. While the programming exercise was short and sweet, the interview was long, around 90 minutes, and involved me live-coding a UI component while screen-sharing, plus quizzes on front end technologies including CSS. It was good preparation for future technical interviews. Even though I did not advance to the next step, it was a positive experience, since the detailed feedback on what could have been better was valued. Since most interviews don’t even provide feedback, TripleByte came out ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>LeetCode</strong></p>\n<p>I am a big fan of crunching through programming exercises, and LeetCode especially shines when you want to become confident for technical interviews. These are core Computing Science programming questions, including how to implement a tree, how to balance it, etc. Preparing for these fundamental questions is essential, as I found out during my Microsoft Software Engineer interview. I’ve through the Easy and Medium exercises in JavaScript, and given the quirkiness of the language, developed some nice talks as a result, especially <a href=\"https://dev.to/heroku/javascript-quirks-numbers-edition-3ppa\">my talk on JavaScript Numbers</a>.</p>\n<h1>Highlights</h1>\n<p><strong>Hired</strong></p>\n<p>I liked the breakdown of which industry the company is in, and the number of engineers; the latter differentiates the startups from more mature companies.\nInterviewing mainly with startups, I enjoyed the direct access to CEO/CTOs. It was great to pick their brains on what the startup life is like, and whether I’d like to be in their shoes.</p>\n<p><strong>TripleByte</strong></p>\n<p>Big fan of taking the practice programming interview, since the feedback is valuable.</p>\n<p><strong>LeetCode</strong></p>\n<p>I love the gamification of getting points for completing problems, and seeing myself advance on the leaderboard. Also enjoy the breadth of programming exercises. A good platform to review core Computing Science problems, and/or to learn about the <a href=\"https://dev.to/heroku/javascript-quirks-numbers-edition-3ppa\">quirks of the language</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/swe-hiring-platoform/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Experiences with Hired, TripleByte, and LeetCode"}},"next":{"html":"<p>I’ve been part of <a href=\"https://www.toastmasters.org\">Toastmasters</a> since January 2014. I was an intern and joined the club to get a job. Instead of getting a job, I got bitten by the public speaking bug. During my third internship I joined <a href=\"https://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club/01488281-salesforce-toastmasters\">Salesforce Toastmasters</a>. The Toastmasters club was one of the reasons I returned to <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com\">Salesforce</a> upon graduation, and I was an active member there for 5 years. Overall I’ve been a Toastmaster member for 7+ years and served as a past President and current Division Director. Here are three ways on how Toastmasters has benefited my career.</p>\n<h3>Seek speaking opportunities at work</h3>\n<p>An experienced Toastmater is a confident speaker with a vast repertoire of speaking experiences. He/she has spoken at various settings, whether that is MCing an online contest, facilitating a panel, or delivering a workshop. Having done all of the above at Toastmasters, I’m confident delivering an experience on front of hundreds of coworkers, whether that is facilitating a panel, MCing a hackathon, or grabbing a 30 minute coffee with a new colleague. How does Toastmasters help with grabbing coffee with someone!? First, you are speaking with another person, so it is public speaking. Second, standard Toastmaster meetings have a section of <a href=\"https://www.toastmasters.org/membership/club-meeting-roles/table-topics-speaker\">Table Topics</a>, where you ask questions to get another person to talk for 1 to 2 minutes. Grabbing coffee is one of the many ways I seek speaking opportunities at work, and having Toastmasters experience gives me a boost of confidence.</p>\n<h3>Craft, tailor, and refine your message</h3>\n<p>After netting a speaking opportunity, what do you say? <strong>Crafting</strong> the message, like any skill, gets better with more practice. My first speech took 12 hours of preparation, now my prep time is &#x3C; 1 hour on many occasions. The message also needs to be <strong>tailored</strong> to the audience: at Salesforce Toastmasters the audience hungered for my personal finance talks, since tech professionals are interested in accumulating wealth. During the Toastmaster’s competition season, the topic turns to self-development to appeal to a wider demographic. Additionally Toastmasters members give feedback on how to <strong>refine</strong> the mesasge. This includes feedback on content, ie. I’m notorious for having too much content, and also the delivery, ie. replace filler words (umms, so’s) with pauses. I make sure I get feedback on my speeches, especially the speeches for work, to improve my speaking skills.</p>\n<h3>Seek leadership experience at work</h3>\n<p>I sought leadership opportunities at Toastmasters to deliver amazing experiences by enlisting the most accomplished, motivated Toastmaster members to be part of my initiatives. Here’s a sample of initiatives I delivered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organized, staffed, and delivered 3 trainings in one month, resulting in ~120 Toastmasters officers trained</li>\n<li>Organized, staffed, and delivered 2 online contests, one with 70+ attendance</li>\n<li>Oversee 25 clubs spanning ~700 Toastmaster members, by working with 4 area directors, each covering 5 clubs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these experiences I’ve ran hackathons at work, and this week I’m moderating a panel of coworkers. Because working with good people and delivering rewarding experiences has an exponentail effect on everyone involved. I’ve gone from a shy intern seeking a job to a confident professional seeking opportunities to assemble teams to deliver wonderful experiences. Any team initative is also a speaking opportunity, where I practice crafting, tailoring, and refining a message. Hence Toastmasters is fully applicable, and a great testing ground for communication and leadership skills.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/toastmasters-experience/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I grew my career through Toastmasters"}}}}}
