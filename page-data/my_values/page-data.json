Life happened despite the pandemic: I traveled and changed jobs as planned. I looked for a set of values behind these decisions to apply for future decision-making. Here’s what I came up with. </p>\n<h2>My values are:</h2>\n<p>Simplicity, Creativity, and Optimize for long-term happiness.</p>\n<h2>Why values matter</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>To provide a framework for <strong>decision-making</strong>: It’s good to have long-term criteria to base the decisions on</li>\n<li>For <strong>protection</strong>: everyone’s value is different and what feels right to others might feel wrong to you. Knowing your values helps to detect and avoid incompatible values.</li>\n<li>For <strong>happiness</strong>: working on what matters will make you happier. Dopamine, a happiness chemical, is <a href=\"https://www.edutopia.org/blog/neurologist-makes-case-video-game-model-learning-tool\">released on incremental progress</a>. It’s 100% legal and free.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How I came up with my values</h2>\n<p>I asked myself these questions:</p>\n<h3>1. What do I need the most in my life?</h3>\n<p>I need <strong>simplicity</strong>. My interests include <a href=\"../ugly-investing\">trading stocks</a> and starting a business, and both deal with complex systems. My job as a software engineer tackles complexity with complexity. I need simplicity to make sense of the world, and to reduce the cognitive load. This means renting instead of buying a house, making fewer trades on the stock market, and making sense of the world by creating.</p>\n<h3>2. Consume vs create</h3>\n<p>I’m a creative person: creating something, even jotting down thoughts, is an enjoyable activity. Consuming too much media, on the other hand, is draining. I consume content from a select few writers and artists. To avoid binging content, I create my own. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, after all.</p>\n<h3>3. Which type of happiness to optimize for</h3>\n<p>There are two types of happiness: <a href=\"https://www.trackinghappiness.com/short-term-long-term-happiness/\">long-term and short-term</a>. Short-term happiness leads to consumerism: eating a lot, drinking a lot, smoking whatnot. It includes buying unnecessary products: <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/retail-therapy-shopping-compulsion/\">retail therapy works</a>, but only short-term.</p>\n<p>Long-term happiness deals with <a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/delayed-gratification-why-wait-for-what-you-want-2795429\">delayed gratification</a>. It’s about minimizing the paycheque while maximizing the retirement account contributions, going to bed early instead of binge-watching YouTube, and exercising instead of window-shopping. It’s about working on personal projects at 6 am and 7 pm instead of binging content. I choose it because the payoff is greater.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Thanks to the pandemic I’ve had time to mull over major decisions. Three values stood out: simplicity, creativity, and long-term happiness. I use them daily for prioritization and planning.</p>\n<p>What are your top three values? And how are you living them?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My top 3 values","date":"June 17, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/my_values/","previous":{"html":"<p>I knew I wanted to work as a software engineer from my first coding internship eight years ago. Here’s what I wish I knew at the beginning of my software engineering journey.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How to <strong>get promoted</strong>: be proactive and figure out what to work on. It also helps to mentor newer engineers, write technical documents, and drive high-profile projects. Clarify which projects to deliver with your manager, set a target date, then follow up on the plan every two weeks.</li>\n<li>Promotion is <em>partially</em> based on merit, and not all work is promote-able. Do not use promotion as a barometer of your progress. You can develop skills outside of work and interview to get a better offer elsewhere.</li>\n<li>There are two ways to view <strong>compensation</strong>. The half-empty view says engineers are undervalued for building scalable products, while the half-full view says we are being compensated to <em>learn</em>, while the learnings translate to the bottom line. Both are true.</li>\n<li><strong>Cultivating a network</strong> is just as important as the actual work. It’s heartwarming to hear from my former colleagues mention the <a href=\"https://github.com/salesforce/refocus\">monitoring project I worked on</a> is still maintained. Who knows, I might end up back at Salesforce someday.</li>\n<li><strong>Open source projects</strong> take a ton of community building to get contributors. Building a community is not a side-gig for a single engineer. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@annyhe\">I know, I tried</a>.</li>\n<li>There is no work-life balance, only <strong>tradeoffs</strong>. Remember technology is the means to an end, both for you as a software engineer, and for the company. </li>\n<li>Most engineers do not <strong>get wealthy</strong> by working for someone else. If the company IPOs and you have a significant stake, you might become a millionaire. It’s like winning the lottery; don’t bank on it.</li>\n<li><strong>Women engineers</strong> exist but <a href=\"https://www.universityaffairs.ca/features/feature-article/the-engineering-gender-gap-its-more-than-a-numbers-game/#:~:text=U.S.%20numbers%20suggest%2040%20percent,Jones.\">our ranks peaked around 1985</a>. I’ve done my share of interviewing interns; we have an equal number of men and women at that level. Yet women are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2020/jan/02/ten-years-on-why-are-there-still-so-few-women-in-tech\">45% more likely than men to drop out of engineering</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizelting/2019/08/21/why-women-quit/?sh=69ded56b16fa\">structural problems causing attrition</a> are too many to list here. The good news? The women engineers’ community is tight and supportive. When I find another female engineer in a sea of men, it’s like finding a unicorn.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Overall it’s been an amazing 8 years: I’ve worked in five different companies, moved from Vancouver to San Francisco, and worked with amazing people across the world.</p>\n<p>Here’s to another 8 years of learning.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/wiwik/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What I wish I knew as a software engineer"}},"next":{"html":"<h4>How I started trading</h4>\n<p>When I was 23 my mother introduced me to a financial advisor at the college campus branch. The advisor encouraged me to open an investment account, and since I had money from working as a software engineer intern, and I already took a corporate finance class at the university, I followed her advice.</p>\n<p>I bought a Canadian index fund and expected to make 7-10% per year. Why? That was the <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/average-stock-market-return#:~:text=The%20average%20stock%20market%20return%20is%20about%2010%25%20per%20year,year%20are%20far%20from%20average.\">widely cited statistic</a>. I thought I’d buy and hold to beat inflation. Easy money.</p>\n<p>I checked the account 1.5 years later and found the account only went up by <strong>2%</strong>, barely keeping up with inflation. </p>\n<p><em>Why 2%, not 7% or 10%?</em></p>\n<p>I asked the financial planner at the campus branch. She pulled up the graph for the 1-year performance and pointed at the midyear dip: “You bought high, that’s why it only netted 2%.” </p>\n<p>She also explained that the index fund is made up of the major Canadian sectors: finance, mining, and real estate, and those industries tend to be slow-moving in a late bull market.\nShe then pulled up another fund that returned 45% during the same year. </p>\n<p><em>What was different with that fund?</em> I asked. </p>\n<p>That fund invested in the US stocks and grew thanks to a weakening Canadian dollar.</p>\n<p>It was as if the wool had been lifted from my eyes; there was so much free information online that affected my returns. From then on whenever someone mentioned an index fund I would look into the fund in detail. Instead of investing in the fund, I’d scour the composition and pick a few stocks to trade.</p>\n<h4>2020: a comparison</h4>\n<p>Fast forward five years later to 2020: the year when I picked an index and stocks. During April 2020 I bought into a mutual fund tracking QQQ (would have been better off with an ETF, but I was overwhelmed from a new job). After purchasing the fund I was curious if I could beat its returns, so I traded stocks in my smaller retirement accounts.</p>\n<p>Which stocks did I trade?</p>\n<p>It was during the epidemic so I looked for battered stocks; there was plenty to pick from. I bought and waited for the rebound of Nordstrom (JWN) and SPG, a REIT.</p>\n<p>The result? The QQQ-tracking fund performed around 60% within a year, but the highest return went to me trading Nordstrom(JWN), generating nearly 3x return in 4 months. In my other account, I’ve invested in SPG and while that didn’t 3x, I still managed to beat the S&#x26;P 500.</p>\n<h4>First-principles of trading</h4>\n<p>Stock trading seems complex, yet it can be boiled down to 5 principles</p>\n<p><strong>1. What to buy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blue-chip Consumer stocks that I can sleep on if I get hit by a bus. Consumer stocks include airlines, clothing retailers (JWN), electronics (Apple), and sometimes REITs. I look for stocks that are relatively stable with high trading volume. I still look at these post correction; the expected returns are lower, but I need some diversification from tech stocks.</li>\n<li>Hand-picked smaller technology stocks eg. &#x3C; $5 billion market cap: I limit these as I already get tech stocks from compensation. These are volatile so I’ll settle for quick gains and less upside e.g. 10% gains in a few days</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. When to buy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Near 52 week low and when there’s momentum. Need both because I don’t wait years for a stock to move; waiting is an opportunity cost</li>\n<li>When there’s a large dip e.g. -10%+ due to a market correction, or an over-correction from an event ie. earnings report</li>\n<li>Target profit is 15%+ within a month, though I’d settle for 10% in a few days</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. How much to buy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contrary to popular belief of spreading the risk, I’ve benefited from going all-in on the rebound of blue-chip Consumer stocks and waiting for a rebound. When there is a sale I buy more</li>\n<li>Technology stocks: when I get the order confirmation I place a limit order for 10% or more. The volatility of these stocks cannot be undestated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. When to sell</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>For technology stocks, when the limit order is triggered</li>\n<li>For turnaround consumer stocks e.g. bought near 52 week low, wait for a rebound to previous levels</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. Risk management: what to do when the market moves against the plan</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For options: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small loss: e.g. sold a put and the option is in the money by a little bit: take the assignment and sell the stock for a profit</li>\n<li>Large loss: roll for a credit. For example, when CRM spiked on earnings and the covered calls were tens of thousands of loss on paper, I rolled forward 10 months for a lower strike price, then closed with a $1,000 loss/contract</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For stocks: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are there better alternatives? For example last year I was tired of waiting for XOM to rebound. Instead of waiting, I switched to SPG, a quality REIT, which was also battered from the pandemic and paid a greater dividend while waiting. </li>\n<li>\n<p>No better alternatives: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Do I still believe that the stock will rebound to 10%+?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Yes: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hold and look for better alternatives, or</li>\n<li>Buy more to lower the cost basis</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>No: sell for a small loss</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Practices and philosophies</h4>\n<p>In addition to the principles, these practices and philosophies affect how I trade</p>\n<p><strong>1. Not taking a risk is a risk.</strong> </p>\n<p>What is safe short-term e.g. savings account and treasury bonds will get hurt by rising inflation. Sitting on money long-term is bad for returns.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Trading is a valuable skill</strong></p>\n<p>Passive indexes print money on bull markets and lose money during corrections. Yet corrections are the best times to make money for the opportunistic trader, so I practice while waiting for a big one. Most of the time I stick with the principles, but I’ve strayed once by <a href=\"../gme-week\">trading GME profitably</a>. I’m trying to get better at avoiding <a href=\"../favorite-option-strategy/\">overtrading options</a>; sometimes buying stock beats selling puts.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Cut the losers.</strong></p>\n<p>Trading means losing small amounts of money to pursue chances of a larger upside, so minimizing the downside is key to profitability. Sometimes I use stop limit orders on stocks, other times I sell for a small loss.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Watch only the key stocks.</strong></p>\n<p>My watchlist has &#x3C;10 stocks. These are quality stocks that are near the purchase price, or stocks I have significant positions in. I rarely trade random stocks on Reddit; each stock comes with its history, industry, fundamentals, risk factors, … </p>\n<p><strong>5. Avoid overtrading.</strong></p>\n<p>A 5% gain in one day is common for certain stocks, but that trade can easily turn into a 10% loss if not managed well. It’s better to sit out than to manage a bad trade. </p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>I’m pretty happy with my returns so far. The best way to learn how to trade is to trade, and I’ve become more confident and remained profitable with time. </p>\n<p>It will be tough in 2021 to generate the same returns as 2020; we’ll see what happens.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/money-philosophy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My trading philosophy"}}}}}
