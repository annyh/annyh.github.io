I’m one month into creating more and here is what I’ve done, what’s working, and the challenges encountered so far.</p>\n<h3>What am I creating?</h3>\n<p><em>To create more than to consume</em> led to some habit changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instead of <strong>reading</strong> blog posts/comics, <strong>write</strong> and <a href=\"https://github.com/annyh/annyh.github.io\">publish my own</a></li>\n<li>Instead of using ready-built apps, <a href=\"../quotes-app\">build an mobile app</a></li>\n<li>Instead of <strong>buying</strong> clothes, <a href=\"../shopping-experience\">sell what I have</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Benefits</h3>\n<p>What are the benefits of those changes?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Memorable experiences</strong>: everyday is exciting because I created a blog post/comic/app </li>\n<li><strong>Faster skill development</strong>: creating apps necessitate just in time learning, and can lead to additional income streams</li>\n<li><strong>Healthier habits</strong>: to accomplish all these while employed, I eat smaller, healthier meals to keep up the energy, and take exercise breaks to recharge</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\n<p>Creating is more challenging than consuming, and it is worth the challenge:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consumption is easier</strong>, yet creation is more fulfilling</li>\n<li><strong>Creating is too time consuming</strong>, and the results are more rewarding </li>\n<li><strong>The creation is ugly</strong>; be aware of implicit comparisons, they are unfair and unproductive </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Methods</h3>\n<p>Here are my 3 ways of creation, and their purpose:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create apps</strong>. Start as weekend projects</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog posts</strong>. To chronicle why, the what, and the how</li>\n<li><strong>Comics</strong>. Some thoughts are more impactful with words <em>and</em> pictures</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Metrics</h3>\n<p>How to measure daily productivity? </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong># of pages written</strong>: whenever I put the pen to paper thoughts pour out. This is the raw material. I target 6 pages of original writing, excluding notes</li>\n<li><strong># of blog posts published</strong>: shaping the raw material into clear thoughts</li>\n<li><strong># of comics created</strong>: this necessitates drawing, a different and more concise medium than words alone</li>\n<li><strong># of git commits</strong>? to show growing coding skills, but quantity doesn’t imply quantity</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Can consumption fuel creation?</h3>\n<p>Mindful consumption can lead to quality creation. The key is to time-bound consumption and specify a clear deliverable.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Books</strong>: reading standing up makes me read faster. I also note down key points, which can jumpstart a blog post/app/comic</li>\n<li><strong>Research to write blog posts</strong>: ie. top 10 female tech bloggers to learn from</li>\n<li><strong>App UX</strong>: what are the similar published apps? Which features to refine and build?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That is how I’m creating more, what about you? Do you enjoy creating more than consuming? Which primary ways do you create? </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to create more than consume","date":"May 20, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/create-more-than-consume/","previous":{"html":"<p>Since one of my guiding principles is <a href=\"../create-more-than-consume/\">to create more than I consume</a>, and I’ve been reading on my phone, I figured why not create a <em>mobile app to direct my reading</em>?\nSpecifically I wanted a <a href=\"https://github.com/annyh/quote-app-react-native\">quotes app</a> to save interesting quotes by interesting people. As for skill level, I’ve dipped my toes in <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/\">React Native</a> (a framework for developing native apps) a few weeks before, and have 5+ years of React and JavaScript experience. Here’s how I, a React Native newbie, designed and created a React Native app over one weekend.</p>\n<h3>Video walkthrough of the <a href=\"https://github.com/annyh/quote-app-react-native\">Quotes App</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e7yGb7OFbI\" title=\"Quote app\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/8e7yGb7OFbI/0.jpg\" alt=\"Quote app\"></a></p>\n<h3>1. Be clear about what the app does</h3>\n<p>For research I looked on Google Play to find quote-saving apps, and found them ad-filled and/or sharing-oriented. Instead I wanted a simple, ad-free interface to save interesting quotes by insteresting people. On Friday post dinner I sketched the app’s UI on a paper notebook, and the sketches set the tone for the development on Saturday.</p>\n<h3>2. Keep the UI simple</h3>\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://react-native-elements.github.io/react-native-elements/docs/overview.html\">react-native-elements</a> for the UI, including a ListView and ButtonGroup. For navigation I used <a href=\"https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/\">react-navigation’s bottom tabs</a> because tabs are faster to access than the collapsible sidebar.</p>\n<h3>3. Reuse code</h3>\n<p>To get quotes I used this <a href=\"https://goodquotesapi.herokuapp.com/#/developer\">Heroku app derived from Goodreads</a>. For data storage I used <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/asyncstorage.html\">AsyncStorage</a>, which stores data on the phone. <a href=\"https://dev.to/amanhimself/what-is-asyncstorage-in-react-native-4af4\">AsyncStorage has a 6MB limit</a> and it’s not a deal-breaker since I’m prototyping and storing short strings. I could have gone with <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/\">Firebase</a> or another database, but given the tight deadline, I reused the AsyncStorage save/delete code, mostly from <a href=\"https://github.com/mahmudahsan/todos-react-reactnative/tree/master/mobile/model\">this repo</a>. </p>\n<h3>4. Some UI decisions are made midway</h3>\n<p>Midway through Saturday I thought about and added a <strong>link to the authors’ Wikipedia page</strong>, since the URL structure is predictable for most English authors. This makes the authors’ backgrounds easy to access. Additionally I noticed how taxing it is for the user to come up with a new search for quotes. So I added the search by <strong>random tag</strong> feature. The <strong>random tag</strong> is one of <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/career/documents/my-career-path-activities/values-exercise.pdf\">100 possible values</a>. Randomization lowers the barriers to discover more interesting quotes.</p>\n<h3>5. Track to dos to work briskly</h3>\n<p>I jot down development tasks in the <a href=\"https://github.com/annyh/quote-app-react-native/blob/master/readme.md#todo\">readme.md</a> so I can pick up where I left off. Also typing out the tasks clarifies the steps for progress.</p>\n<h3>That’s a wrap!</h3>\n<p>It was a productive weekend, with enough time leftover to take <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e7yGb7OFbI\">a video</a> and write up this blog post. The <a href=\"https://github.com/annyh/quote-app-react-native\">source code is here</a>. It still has <a href=\"https://github.com/annyh/quote-app-react-native/blob/master/readme.md#todo\">some to dos</a>, so I can pick it up during the week, or another weekend :)</p>","fields":{"slug":"/first-react-native-app/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Creating a React Native app over a weekend"}},"next":null}}}
