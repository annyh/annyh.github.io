It aims to convince the end-user to adopt a proprietary product. I think of it as a sale to get the person to invest their time into using the product, and the result is increased product adoption in their workplace. Ideally, the customer becomes an advocate and spreads the best practice to others, thus scaling the marketing efforts.</p>\n<h4>The business case for Developer Evangelism</h4>\n<p>Picture a growing technology company. Its product is complex so it needs customization. The product is sold to organizations on a subscription model; a lack of product adoption means losing business.</p>\n<p>How to solve this problem? Developer evangelists are people who evangelize the product in a scalable manner e.g. get feedback from user groups, write technical tutorials, share usage videos targeting the end-users to encourage product adoption. Increased product adoption means increased ROI for the customer organization and facilitates expanding market share.</p>\n<h4>How did I get into developer evangelism?</h4>\n<p>I was a software engineer working on a project used to monitor Salesforce’s online services. The project was open source and I, as the second engineer on the project, set out to market the project on a minimal budget. I spoke at open source conferences to drive adoption among external developers. Meanwhile, an internal job post at Salesforce described my promotional efforts to a tee, the difference is I’d be promoting Salesforce’s latest product offerings. </p>\n<p>I jumped at the chance to learn from the industry’s best on how to market enterprise software.</p>\n<h4>Favorite thing about the role</h4>\n<p>Salesforce out-markets its competitors: no other company has such die-hard fans. These fans come from all walks of life: they are veteran entrepreneurs, volunteers who teach Salesforce on Saturdays, and people giving up their weekends to learn and join the “Salesforce economy”. Speaking in front of them was a little intense because someone in the audience might have used </p>\n<p>Salesforce for years and knew things I didn’t, but whenever I presented they were supportive, smiled, and listened.  </p>\n<h4>Highlights from business travel</h4>\n<p>While I was an evangelist I was part of team Trailhead at Salesforce, which tripled in headcount within 1.5 years. We worked hard but also played hard. Highlights with coworkers include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Eating with coworkers at a Michelin star restaurant at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas, where a Peking duck was carved by a team of three in front of our eyes</li>\n<li>Hiking in Phoenix in Arizona, and learning about which cacti were edible (I don’t remember which ones, but it was a gorgeous day)</li>\n<li>A three-day safari in Kenya (I volunteered in Africa) at an eco-lodge resembling the Pride Rock in Lion King. We saw the entire cast of Lion King, saw a lioness at a watering hole, drove near zebras and giraffes, heard hyenas laugh at night, and slept under the stars (with a mosquito net)</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Life was great! Why did I switch back to software engineering?</h4>\n<p>I loved my job as a Developer Evangelist. It was hard to believe that I, with English was my third language, was hired by one of the most respected tech companies to present their technology offerings.</p>\n<p>As much as I enjoyed presenting to large technical audiences (my biggest one was around 150 people in one room at Dreamforce), at the end of the day I missed building the product. I’m a product-centric person at heart, and working in a service role, with its tight deadlines, was wearing me down.</p>\n<p>I remember being at the airport and my manager called me from the UK saying I’d need to draft a step-by-step tutorial within 24 hours. I was planning to meet with my <a href=\"../toastmasters-experience/\">Toastmaster friends</a> for a Christmas social, but work took priority. I went to the office to pick up something then stayed in the lobby to pound out that draft. While pounding on the keyboard I saw my friends meet up in the lobby, smile and laugh, and leave for the restaurant.\nThe trips were exciting, and they were not free.</p>\n<h4>To beyond</h4>\n<p>When a Splunk recruiter reached out on LinkedIn with a software engineer position on Splunk’s flagship product, I said hello. I knew Splunk had a great product from engineers; they only complained about its price. I got an offer from Splunk and had to decide between developing a product, or staying in the evangelism role.</p>\n<p>I chose the former and so far I’m happily developing products at Splunk. It feels good being back as a software engineer, where the code I write directly impacts the customer experience.\nSplunk has great ambitions as an enterprise software company, and I can’t wait to help it get to Salesforce scale.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"To developer evangelism and beyond","date":"June 21, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/developer-evangelism/","previous":{"html":"<h4>How I started trading</h4>\n<p>When I was 23 my mother introduced me to a financial advisor at the college campus branch. The advisor encouraged me to open an investment account, and since I had money from working as a software engineer intern, and I already took a corporate finance class at the university, I followed her advice.</p>\n<p>I bought a Canadian index fund and expected to make 7-10% per year. Why? That was the <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/average-stock-market-return#:~:text=The%20average%20stock%20market%20return%20is%20about%2010%25%20per%20year,year%20are%20far%20from%20average.\">widely cited statistic</a>. I thought I’d buy and hold to beat inflation. Easy money.</p>\n<p>I checked the account 1.5 years later and found the account only went up by <strong>2%</strong>, barely keeping up with inflation. </p>\n<p><em>Why 2%, not 7% or 10%?</em></p>\n<p>I asked the financial planner at the campus branch. She pulled up the graph for the 1-year performance and pointed at the midyear dip: “You bought high, that’s why it only netted 2%.” </p>\n<p>She also explained that the index fund is made up of the major Canadian sectors: finance, mining, and real estate, and those industries tend to be slow-moving in a late bull market.\nShe then pulled up another fund that returned 45% during the same year. </p>\n<p><em>What was different with that fund?</em> I asked. </p>\n<p>That fund invested in the US stocks and grew thanks to a weakening Canadian dollar.</p>\n<p>It was as if the wool had been lifted from my eyes; there was so much free information online that affected my returns. From then on whenever someone mentioned an index fund I would look into the fund in detail. Instead of investing in the fund, I’d scour the composition and pick a few stocks to trade.</p>\n<h4>2020: a comparison</h4>\n<p>Fast forward five years later to 2020: the year when I picked an index and stocks. During April 2020 I bought into a mutual fund tracking QQQ (would have been better off with an ETF, but I was overwhelmed from a new job). After purchasing the fund I was curious if I could beat its returns, so I traded stocks in my smaller retirement accounts.</p>\n<p>Which stocks did I trade?</p>\n<p>It was during the epidemic so I looked for battered stocks; there was plenty to pick from. I bought and waited for the rebound of Nordstrom (JWN) and SPG, a REIT.</p>\n<p>The result? The QQQ-tracking fund performed around 60% within a year, but the highest return went to me trading Nordstrom(JWN), generating nearly 3x return in 4 months. In my other account, I’ve invested in SPG and while that didn’t 3x, I still managed to beat the S&#x26;P 500.</p>\n<h4>First-principles of trading</h4>\n<p>Stock trading seems complex, yet it can be boiled down to 5 principles</p>\n<p><strong>1. What to buy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blue-chip Consumer stocks that I can sleep on if I get hit by a bus. Consumer stocks include airlines, clothing retailers (JWN), electronics (Apple), and sometimes REITs. I look for stocks that are relatively stable with high trading volume. I still look at these post correction; the expected returns are lower, but I need some diversification from tech stocks.</li>\n<li>Hand-picked smaller technology stocks eg. &#x3C; $5 billion market cap: I limit these as I already get tech stocks from compensation. These are volatile so I’ll settle for quick gains and less upside e.g. 10% gains in a few days</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. When to buy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Near 52 week low and when there’s momentum. Need both because I don’t wait years for a stock to move; waiting is an opportunity cost</li>\n<li>When there’s a large dip e.g. -10%+ due to a market correction, or an over-correction from an event ie. earnings report</li>\n<li>Target profit is 15%+ within a month, though I’d settle for 10% in a few days</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. How much to buy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contrary to popular belief of spreading the risk, I’ve benefited from going all-in on the rebound of blue-chip Consumer stocks and waiting for a rebound. When there is a sale I buy more</li>\n<li>Technology stocks: when I get the order confirmation I place a limit order for 10% or more. The volatility of these stocks cannot be undestated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. When to sell</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>For technology stocks, when the limit order is triggered</li>\n<li>For turnaround consumer stocks e.g. bought near 52 week low, wait for a rebound to previous levels</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. Risk management: what to do when the market moves against the plan</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For options: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small loss: e.g. sold a put and the option is in the money by a little bit: take the assignment and sell the stock for a profit</li>\n<li>Large loss: roll for a credit. For example, when CRM spiked on earnings and the covered calls were tens of thousands of loss on paper, I rolled forward 10 months for a lower strike price, then closed with a $1,000 loss/contract</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For stocks: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are there better alternatives? For example last year I was tired of waiting for XOM to rebound. Instead of waiting, I switched to SPG, a quality REIT, which was also battered from the pandemic and paid a greater dividend while waiting. </li>\n<li>\n<p>No better alternatives: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Do I still believe that the stock will rebound to 10%+?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Yes: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hold and look for better alternatives, or</li>\n<li>Buy more to lower the cost basis</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>No: sell for a small loss</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Practices and philosophies</h4>\n<p>In addition to the principles, these practices and philosophies affect how I trade</p>\n<p><strong>1. Not taking a risk is a risk.</strong> </p>\n<p>What is safe short-term e.g. savings account and treasury bonds will get hurt by rising inflation. Sitting on money long-term is bad for returns.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Trading is a valuable skill</strong></p>\n<p>Passive indexes print money on bull markets and lose money during corrections. Yet corrections are the best times to make money for the opportunistic trader, so I practice while waiting for a big one. Most of the time I stick with the principles, but I’ve strayed once by <a href=\"../gme-week\">trading GME profitably</a>. I’m trying to get better at avoiding <a href=\"../favorite-option-strategy/\">overtrading options</a>; sometimes buying stock beats selling puts.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Cut the losers.</strong></p>\n<p>Trading means losing small amounts of money to pursue chances of a larger upside, so minimizing the downside is key to profitability. Sometimes I use stop limit orders on stocks, other times I sell for a small loss.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Watch only the key stocks.</strong></p>\n<p>My watchlist has &#x3C;10 stocks. These are quality stocks that are near the purchase price, or stocks I have significant positions in. I rarely trade random stocks on Reddit; each stock comes with its history, industry, fundamentals, risk factors, … </p>\n<p><strong>5. Avoid overtrading.</strong></p>\n<p>A 5% gain in one day is common for certain stocks, but that trade can easily turn into a 10% loss if not managed well. It’s better to sit out than to manage a bad trade. </p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>I’m pretty happy with my returns so far. The best way to learn how to trade is to trade, and I’ve become more confident and remained profitable with time. </p>\n<p>It will be tough in 2021 to generate the same returns as 2020; we’ll see what happens.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/money-philosophy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My trading philosophy"}},"next":null}}}
