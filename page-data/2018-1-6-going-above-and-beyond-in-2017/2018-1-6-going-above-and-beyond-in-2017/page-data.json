Because marketing makes technology sexy, the same way Ginger Rogers made Fred Astaire sexy. Also no one is doing marketing for my team yet. Besides me. Prime time for learning. </p>\n<p>Here is a sample of what I did for my team in 2017, outside of coding. Did I mention all of these are volunteer work, aka no one asked me to do it? </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Conceived and organized a <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/visualizemydata/events/238756680/\">meetup</a> to gather user feedback about our open source project <a href=\"https://github.com/salesforce/refocus\">refocus</a></li>\n<li>Conceived and organized the knowledge sharing session between Site Reliability Tools in Salesforce and the equivalent team at Lyft</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPBK-qaGFKI\">Spoke and demoed</a> our open source project <a href=\"https://github.com/salesforce/refocus\">refocus</a> at two conferences</li>\n<li>Procured board games at our workspace to enliven the space and get creative juices flowing</li>\n<li>Organized and stepped in last minute to present <a href=\"https://github.com/salesforce/refocus\">refocus</a> at the internal Tech Talk, and demoed its sky-is-the-limit customizability</li>\n<li>Organized the inaugural hackathon at our department</li>\n<li>Wrote and published the blog post on <a href=\"https://engineering.salesforce.com/https-medium-com-annyhe-nerdy-new-years-resolution-share-your-technical-project-at-a-conference-5c2719d3684c\">how to promote technology projects at conferences</a>, published on Salesforce Engineering blog.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Notice a pattern? These are all transferable skills that I can apply elsewhere in my career. It also helps that I have the team’s and the management’s support: my team attended the first conference talk, and the company paid for the second conference trip. My manager’s manager congratulated me on the published blog post, and the Lyft knowledge share was also mentioned at the VP level. What I do makes our team and the company look good.</p>\n<p>If you were wondering whether I slacked off at my regular job, I did not. These are all on top of regular coding work. I also stepped in and remediated the void created by the departure of a senior developer. I acquire soft skills on top of technical chops. </p>\n<p>Do I expect each one of my efforts to be rewarded by the management? That would be nice. However it is my career that I am building, and nothing beats learning on the job. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What do I do besides writing code at work?","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018-1-6-going-above-and-beyond-in-2017/2018-1-6-going-above-and-beyond-in-2017/","previous":{"html":"<p>The movie Office Space was recommended by a highly esteemed colleague. Since we both work in Software Engineering and the movie features two software engineers, plus the movie is written and directed by Mike Judge (of Silicon Valley fame), I watched it with my boyfriend, who also works as a Software Engineer. Spoiler alert! </p>\n<p><strong>1. Most people hate work</strong></p>\n<p>This has been my hunch since I was 16, when I worked briefly in fast food. I see boredom on the commuters’ faces. Now that I work in the office environment, it is rare to see happy people there. The movie validates the hunch.</p>\n<p><strong>2. White boys play gangster music to appear cool and tough</strong></p>\n<p>Really, is there no other way to connote coolness and toughness? Do office-working caucasian men with eye glasses rely on rap to feel powerful? </p>\n<p>Also there was a lack of racial representation in the movie. That merits another article.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Passive aggressive managers are a pain</strong></p>\n<p>Bill Lumbergh (Peter’s manager) ends his sentences with: “that would be great”. He smiles while telling his team what to do, asking them for a favor that won’t be reciprocated. He also repeatedly reminded Peter on the TPS report. The nit-pick, lukewarm approach on telling people what to do, plus a lack of promotion, motivation, and relationship-building, de-motivates the team. Some corporations treat their workers like robots, but making them feel like they are treated like one is bad management. </p>\n<p>Even worse, Joanna’s manager attemps to motivate Joanna to wear more plastic corporate buttons by lecturing her on how the buttons are a sign of self expression. Joanna sees through his weak attempt and asks whether he is telling her to wear more buttons. He trudges on with the attempt, until Joanna gets fed up and flips the finger. In the fast food industry, where the pay is low and workers already feel unappreciated and treated like mere bodies, being lectured in such a way is entertaining at best, demeaning at worst.</p>\n<p><strong>4. In pursuit of short term profits, the company will let go of their most precious asset</strong></p>\n<p>Experienced programmers are worth much more than what they are paid: their knowledge of the ins and outs of a system is difficult to replace, regardless of who fills their seat. More frighteningly, there was no reasonable precedent to let go of the programmers; the managers haphazardly heeded the consultant’s advice. This was one of the absurd highlights of the movie. </p>\n<p>Who benefits? Their next employer, who gets experienced talent that won’t otherwise be on the job market.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Given a million dollars, most people will not go back to their jobs</strong></p>\n<p>Why? Because most people work for the paycheck. Because their passive-aggressive manager wrings the bare minimum from them, keeping the costs low. This is a vicious cycle until the company lets go of employees to save money. People work for the money. If one has money, there is no need to work. </p>\n<p><strong>6. A worker’s attitude towards work will reflect on his/her social standing</strong></p>\n<p>The less you care about the work, the more likely you are to get fired/promoted. Being respectful and differential to the manager gets you nowhere. Or let go because a consultant said so, and the company paid an arm and a leg for the consulant’s services, so their advice “has” to be good. </p>\n<p><strong>7. People become attached to material possessions</strong></p>\n<p>Lumbergh moved Milton’s cubicle several times, and took away Milton’s treasured shiny red stapler, in an effort to get him to quit. These are Lumbergh’s passive-aggressive tactics. Nevertheless Milton’s attachment to the location of his cubicle and the stapler was alarming.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Tom Smykowski’s failure to correctly attribute the source of his windfall</strong></p>\n<p>Tom’s windfall payout was from the drunk driver who hit him, not from his 30 years of work at the company that unceremoniously dumped him. Yet his advice to Peter was: ”… if you hang in there long enough, good things can happen in this world.” But the payout came because the car accident, not from the company. Sunk cost fallacy?</p>\n<p><strong>9. When all else fails, set the company building on fire</strong></p>\n<p>The hilarious climax of the movie is when we see the company on fire, the arsonist being the most abused character, Milton. For the heroic action, he deserved the windfall payout in the envelope.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Lack of women in key roles: what would have changed?</strong></p>\n<p>Jennifer Aniston lit up the screen, a standout among the sausage fest of mostly caucasian men. Would things been different if Bill Lumbergh, Peter’s boss, was a woman? Would her team hate her less, or more? There were no women in power in that office. We can only stipulate what difference that would have made.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>This is a highly recommended comedy. There’s truth in jest: in real life, I saw hardworking people get laid off, while those who did not care rise in the ranks. </p>\n<p>People get attached to their work, their title, and material things at work. Yet the attachment comes at a price: unhappiness, disappointment from unmet needs, and the hurt from the abrupt departure. Lesson learned? Leave when the going is good. Or start your own company. Why not? </p>\n<p>That is what I would do with a million dollars.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2018-2-11-what-I-learned-from-watching-the-Office-Space/2018-2-11-what-I-learned-from-watching-the-Office-Space/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"10 Lessons from the Office Space"}},"next":{"html":"<p>I organized a geographically-distributed, week-long hackathon at Salesforce. Why did I do it? Because I wanted to do a hack, and the bigger company-wide hackathons were only twice a year. At Salesforce, hackathons are the perfect place to showcase one’s ingenuity: Every hack has the potential to become implemented at work. Hence I heeded the famous saying: “if you want something to happen, do it yourself”.</p>\n<p>This was my first time organizing a hackathon. Here’s what I learnd from trial by fire.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Executive buy-in is crucial</strong></p>\n<p>The hackathon was sponsored partially to help meet our VP’s targets. While metrics were the impetus, the output of the hackathon, including the knowledge that the team gained from participation, and the demos, were worth much more than the food and prize budget.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Have at least three organizers</strong></p>\n<p>Have one person close to the funding source, one who setups up and operate the AV, and at least one champion per different location. Different job roles also helped: we made the hackathon a week long because the operations person mentioned 24 hours in a week is much more flexible than any strict day. The change of duration gave us an unprecedented number of entries, double the amount expected for an inaugural hackathon.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Delegate, delegate, delegate</strong></p>\n<p>Since I was the champion for the project, the onus was on me to make it happen. I tapped into the wide variety of skills and the deep expertise of our team. Request for judges, t-shirt design, and lunch order + pickup were handled by team mates. Their contributions made the hackathon a success.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Mine the previous hackathon organizers’ experience</strong></p>\n<p>I reached out to the organizer of the company-wide hackathon. She has been running multiple hackathons per year for several years. How to convert teams to participants, which system to use for signup and video upload, and the format of the final judging were only the tip of the iceberg. While there was much to digest, standing on the shoulders of giants gave me the confidence to continue.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Leverage temporary authority to build relationships</strong></p>\n<p>Having the responsibility to spearhead the hackathon, and the VP-approved authority to make it happen, gave me the impetus to talk to many people. Hackathon was our shared topic. If the person is technical, I asked about their ideas and the progress of their project. If they were more on the business side, I encouraged them to join a team to give feedback. Or at least come to the final judging, to feast on the free food and be amazed by the bright technical minds of our organization. Because of my hallway/water cooler talks, more people know me by name, and it feels good to be acknowledged in the hallway.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Go where others fear to tread</strong></p>\n<p>Organizing the hackathon was a ton of work, since it involved various people and leveraging their expertise. I was also contestant in the hacakthon, and did my regular work as a software engineer. It was my busiest week so far at Salesforce. But I don’t fear being busy. Few people would organize AND compete in the same hackathon. Yet it is precisely because so few people would even consider organizing the event, that made driving this event worthwhile. </p>\n<p>Overall it was a high-profile networking experience. Our VP thanked me on front of all the participants and judges, and the output of the hackathon will be treasured for the years to come. I learned much from championing the first hackathon of our team. </p>","fields":{"slug":"/2018-1-20-lessons-from-organizing-a-hackathon/2018-1-20-lessons-from-organizing-a-hackathon/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"6 Lessons from Organizing a Hackathon"}}}}}
