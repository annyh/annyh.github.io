Here are my experiences distilled in 5 rules</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Don’t lose money</strong>. This is challenging: there’s inflation, taxes, major medical costs, etc. Collorary: health is wealth, and tax efficiency matters</li>\n<li><strong>Not taking a risk is a risk</strong>. Collorary: what is safe short term may not be long term, ie. no job is permanent</li>\n<li><strong>Managing money is a valuable skill</strong>: you can learn it or outsource it. Either way it will cost $$$</li>\n<li><strong>Only invest in quality stocks</strong>. My shares in Home Depot and Apple have doubled in price in less than 2 years. Buy and hold is a valid long term strategy</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid overtrading</strong>. Journal every entry</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’m learning to trade options to take advantage of the specially volatile stock market. Will share the results soon.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My money philosophy","date":"June 21, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/money-philosophy/","previous":{"html":"<p>7 Gigs I did from age 12 to 28, excluding <a href=\"../what-i-do-at-work\">software engineering jobs</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.girlguides.ca/web/GGC/?_ga=2.264388044.271949957.1592773465-1459434870.1592773465\">Girl guide</a> cookies</strong>: $200+ sales. I was 12 years old. Biggest payday was selling in front of Safeway with another Girl Guide. She became the top seller and I was #2. I was surprised how adults didn’t buy cookies to consume; they bought to support the cause</li>\n<li><strong>Paper route</strong>: &#x3C;$100. I took over someone else’s route for two months. I remember the smell of printed ads as I shoved them into the newspaper, and  the relaxation of an afternoon stroll in the nearby neighborhood. Too bad the local papers are declining; it was a great starter job</li>\n<li><strong>Cashier at restaurant</strong>: $800 overall for part time summer work, $9/hour. I was hungry at the restaurant; we were allowed unlimited soda and one burger every four hours. I avoided the soda and was too busy to enjoy the burger</li>\n<li><strong>Bagpiper at funeral</strong>: $250/hour. I played bagpipes for 7 years and performed at a funeral home. It was gratifying to set my own rate and get it</li>\n<li><strong>Commissioned muralist</strong>: $500. I was commissioned by my former elementary school.
