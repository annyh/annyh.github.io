This is challenging: there’s inflation, taxes, major medical costs, etc. Collorary: health is wealth, and tax efficiency matters</li>\n<li><strong>Not taking a risk is a risk</strong>. Collorary: what is safe short term may not be long term, ie. no job is permanent</li>\n<li><strong>Managing money is a valuable skill</strong>: you can learn it or outsource it. Either way it will cost $$$</li>\n<li><strong>Only invest in quality stocks</strong>. My shares in Home Depot and Apple have doubled in price in less than 2 years. Buy and hold is a valid long term strategy</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid overtrading</strong>.

I was 12 years old. The biggest payday was selling in front of Safeway with another Girl Guide. She became the top seller and I was #2. I was surprised how adults didn’t buy cookies to consume; they bought to support the cause</li>\n<li><strong>Paper route</strong>: &#x3C;$100. I took over someone else’s route for two months. I remember the smell of printed ads as I shoved them into the newspaper and  the relaxation of an afternoon stroll in the nearby neighborhood. Too bad the local papers are declining; it was a great starter job</li>\n<li><strong>Babysitting and tutoring</strong>: I tried each just once, taking care of a neighbor’s two children during one evening and making art with another neighbor’s son. Both opportunities were unsolicited; the neighbors knew I was around, and it also helped the building’s most advertised babysitter was 11 years old. Looking back I could have taken the opportunity to expand the business during my college years </li>\n<li><strong>Being a cashier at a restaurant</strong>: $800 overall for part-time summer work, $9/hour. I was hungry at the restaurant; we were allowed unlimited soda and one burger every four hours. I avoided the soda and was too busy to enjoy the burger</li>\n<li><strong>Bagpiper at a funeral</strong>: $250/hour. I played bagpipes for 7 years and performed at a funeral home. It was gratifying to set my rate and get it</li>\n<li><strong>Commissioned muralist</strong>: I was commissioned for $500 by my former elementary school. The painting was appropriate for all ages, set against a backdrop of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Starry_Night\">van Gogh’s Starry Night</a>. This is the only time I was paid for my art; I’ve shown my art at curated galleries without pay</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cutco.com/\"><strong>Sold kitchen knives</strong></a>: >$2000 revenue, &#x3C;$650 take home. As my first gig in university, I rode buses to sell knives to high school teachers. I felt high whenever I made a sale :)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://poshmark.com/\"><strong>Poshmark</strong></a>: $430 take home. Being paid to declutter feels great, especially since Goodwill is closed due to the pandemic. This also taught me to <a href=\"../shopping-ban\">avoid buying more clothes</a>; they are nontrivial to unload</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I love doing self-directed work.

The question becomes: how to learn options from trustworthy sources? I take ideas from hand-picked resources and practice using <a href=\"https://platform.thinkorswim.com/platform/index.html#!/pmregister\">TD’s paperMoney</a> to paper trade. The account is free and I highly recommend it! Here’s a video on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIItAEsqumQ\">how to get started with paperMoney</a>.</p>\n<h3>What kind of trader am I?</h3>\n<p>An investor’s <strong>core style</strong> and <strong>goals</strong> dictate the trading strategies. I’m a <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-buy-and-hold-2466543\">buy and hold</a> investor; it’s hard to beat the appreciation of great companies bought on a discount. For example I bought <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HD/\">Home Depot</a> and <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/\">Apple</a> when they were discounted from news of a potential tariff war between the US and China. Both have appreciated almost 100% a year later.</p>\n<p>My <strong>goal</strong> is to use options to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hedge a few concentrated positions </li>\n<li>Generate income from those positions</li>\n<li>Purchase more shares on a discount</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Trade ideas</h3>\n<p>To generate ‘income’ and to buy stocks on sale I sell <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/options-strategy-guide/shortput-cashsecured\">cash-secured puts</a>. So far I’ve made 10% in one month, and have been assigned once. The assingment was for <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPG/\">SPG</a>, a quality mall REIT at a $65, a low price for the stock. Another stock I’m trading options on is <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ALK/\">ALK</a>. I enjoy flying Alaska; it is the only airline that I’ve been drunk on (thanks mai tai!). Both stocks are volatile thanks to COVID, and I’m conservatively making money off of the price action.</p>\n<p>I also follow a few financial bloggers on options trading. I don’t purchase their services ie. courses or trade alerts, but follow them because their trading strategies align with my goals. One blogger advocates for <a href=\"https://www.great-option-trading-strategies.com/selling-puts.html\">selling puts</a> to get stocks on a discount, which I agree with and have <em>put</em> to good use (pardon the pun). Another blogger advocates for using <a href=\"https://beststockstrategy.com/selling-puts-strategy/\">a small watchlist</a> to decrease time on research and to buy only the best stocks. I agree with that so I’ve added it to my practice.\nI also agree with keeping 40-45% account available to limit potential losses, and for closing orders early ie. place an order to buy back the put at 50% of the original premium. I don’t agree with everything I read though; for example I disagree with having no equity in a portfolio; again, I’m a buy and hold investor. So I read broadly but only practice what resonates with me. </p>\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n<p>I’m a huge fan of TD ameritrade videos; they are just as entertaining as Netflix, much shorter than Netflix, and help you make money to pay for Netflix. My favorite videos include <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euAs1f3V27s\">trading on margin</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCAcb6OenhY\">drawdown</a>. The latter illustrates how recovering a loss takes a greater percentage: ie. if lose 10% of account, need 11% to return to initial balance. The reminder keeps me from being greedy.</p>\n<p>The Ameritrade blog posts are also good. For example this one on <a href=\"https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/the-utility-player-how-big-should-my-options-trade-be-17500\">option sizing</a>. While the blog posts are admittedly less visual than the videos, I love how easy they are to scan. Also like this blog post on <a href=\"https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/ira-options-trading-16786\">trading in the retirement account</a>.</p>\n<p>That’s it for now! Trading options is not for everyone, I’m having fun and learning lots. So far I’ve made money trading volatile and battered stocks. Looking forward to how well I do in a year. </p>","fields":{"slug":"/learn-options/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Resources for trading options"}}}}}
