I was an intern and joined the club to get a job. Instead of getting a job, I got bitten by the public speaking bug. During my third internship I joined <a href=\"https://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club/01488281-salesforce-toastmasters\">Salesforce Toastmasters</a>. The Toastmasters club was one of the reasons I returned to <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com\">Salesforce</a> upon graduation, and I was an active member there for 5 years. Overall I’ve been a Toastmaster member for 7+ years and served as a past President and current Division Director. Here are three ways on how Toastmasters has benefited my career.</p>\n<h3>Seek speaking opportunities at work</h3>\n<p>An experienced Toastmater is a confident speaker with a vast repertoire of speaking experiences. He/she has spoken at various settings, whether that is MCing an online contest, facilitating a panel, or delivering a workshop. Having done all of the above at Toastmasters, I’m confident delivering an experience on front of hundreds of coworkers, whether that is facilitating a panel, MCing a hackathon, or grabbing a 30 minute coffee with a new colleague. How does Toastmasters help with grabbing coffee with someone!? First, you are speaking with another person, so it is public speaking. Second, standard Toastmaster meetings have a section of <a href=\"https://www.toastmasters.org/membership/club-meeting-roles/table-topics-speaker\">Table Topics</a>, where you ask questions to get another person to talk for 1 to 2 minutes. Grabbing coffee is one of the many ways I seek speaking opportunities at work, and having Toastmasters experience gives me a boost of confidence.</p>\n<h3>Craft, tailor, and refine your message</h3>\n<p>After netting a speaking opportunity, what do you say? <strong>Crafting</strong> the message, like any skill, gets better with more practice. My first speech took 12 hours of preparation, now my prep time is &#x3C; 1 hour on many occasions. The message also needs to be <strong>tailored</strong> to the audience: at Salesforce Toastmasters the audience hungered for my personal finance talks, since tech professionals are interested in accumulating wealth. During the Toastmaster’s competition season, the topic turns to self-development to appeal to a wider demographic. Additionally Toastmasters members give feedback on how to <strong>refine</strong> the mesasge. This includes feedback on content, ie. I’m notorious for having too much content, and also the delivery, ie. replace filler words (umms, so’s) with pauses. I make sure I get feedback on my speeches, especially the speeches for work, to improve my speaking skills.</p>\n<h3>Seek leadership experience at work</h3>\n<p>I sought leadership opportunities at Toastmasters to deliver amazing experiences by enlisting the most accomplished, motivated Toastmaster members to be part of my initiatives. Here’s a sample of initiatives I delivered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organized, staffed, and delivered 3 trainings in one month, resulting in ~120 Toastmasters officers trained</li>\n<li>Organized, staffed, and delivered 2 online contests, one with 70+ attendance</li>\n<li>Oversee 25 clubs spanning ~700 Toastmaster members, by working with 4 area directors, each covering 5 clubs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these experiences I’ve ran hackathons at work, and this week I’m moderating a panel of coworkers. Because working with good people and delivering rewarding experiences has an exponentail effect on everyone involved. I’ve gone from a shy intern seeking a job to a confident professional seeking opportunities to assemble teams to deliver wonderful experiences. Any team initative is also a speaking opportunity, where I practice crafting, tailoring, and refining a message. Hence Toastmasters is fully applicable, and a great testing ground for communication and leadership skills.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How I grew my career through Toastmasters","date":"April 21, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/toastmasters-experience/","previous":{"html":"<p>After several years of emotional shopping I need a break. Thanks to sites like <a href=\"https://www.thredup.com/\">thredup</a>, <a href=\"https://poshmark.com\">poshmark</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/\">eBay</a>, I spent countless hours browsing online, resulting in overflowing closets, mindless spending, and less savings. Why is less savings troubling? A dollar invested today, assuming a 7% growth rate, <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/rule72.htm\">will double in 10 years</a>.\nInspired by the <a href=\"https://caitflanders.com/shopping-ban/\">shopping ban by Cate Flanders</a>, I designed a shopping ban for myself, with custom rules.</p>\n<h3>The Rules</h3>\n<p>For simplicity there are two buckets of spending: one is banned, another not banned.</p>\n<h5>Banned categories:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>clothing</strong>: it feels bad spending good money on emotional purchases, meaning purchases made when I felt lonely, homesick, or bored. Instead of shopping for clothes I will call my parents and forge stronger relationships. Additionally I will use the saved time to develop programming and drawing skills, and investing knowledge</li>\n<li><strong>art supplies</strong>: After a buying-spree on colored markers, I’m good for a few years</li>\n<li><strong>online courses</strong>: I’ve considered paying for <a href=\"https://www.skillshare.com\">Skillshare</a> for drawing courses and <a href=\"https://www.pluralsight.com/\">Pluralsight</a> for technical knowledge, however their free content is sufficient. I use <a href=\"https://sfpl.org/research-learn/elearning\">LinkedIn Learning, it is free with my library membership</a>; LinkedIn Learning has good courses on technology and personal finance. Additionally I already have an annual subscription for <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/\">DataCamp</a>, and they specialize in Python and Data Science. </li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Categories outside the ban:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>food</strong>: my monthly expenditure is already low</li>\n<li><strong>travel</strong>: my budget is already &#x3C; $1000/year</li>\n<li><strong>books</strong>: I have a soft spot for buying used books. I read 80% of the books I buy, and on average they cost &#x3C; $10 each</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking forward to a year of less spending, less clutter, and more savings!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/shopping-ban/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Year-long Shopping ban, from 4/2020 to 4/2021"}},"next":{"html":"<p>Weeks into <a href=\"../shopping-ban\">my shopping ban</a> I’ve given in to the siren calls of online spending, and placed not one, but five orders. All were on the same site, <a href=\"https://poshmark.com/\">Poshmark</a>, a peer to peer fashion reselling platform. With my large closet choking with too many clothes, and realizing that I don’t wear 50% of what is in there, Poshmark seems the perfect place to sell. Perhaps I can recoup some, if not all of the money I’ve spent on it over the last three years?</p>\n<h3>The fashion reselling experiment</h3>\n<p>This is my second Poshmark sellilng experience. The <a href=\"https://poshmark.com/posh_guide/how_to_list_item\">selling process</a> is well documented so I won’t go into it here. The first time I’ve listed 20 items, mostly shoes. This time I have more to sell, so I listed 50 items, including shoes, blazers, and books. I spent one entire Saturday taking pictures under the natural light, and for each clothing item, taking multiple photos to show the measurements. My reasoning was, if I can de-risk my listing by providing measurements, perhaps the user would pay more for the item. To be on the safe side, I priced all my items around the lower range of existing listings, hoping for a quick sale on most items.</p>\n<h6>Saturday results</h6>\n<p>Unfortunately my hopes were dashed that same evening. The first offer was a lowball offer, offering me $10 for a <a href=\"https://poshmark.com/listing/Ted-Baker-size-2-wool-black-vest-5eacb169ac9702395aee955d\">wool Ted Baker vest</a> with a listing price of $30. For context, that vest has retail price of $200. I understand the concept of sunk cost, but the lowball sting hurt so much that I immediately countered to $25, $5 below the listing price. The potential buyer didn’t budge, so no sale on that vest for that day. </p>\n<p>Another offer came in for a pair of pilgrim <a href=\"https://poshmark.com/listing/John-fluevog-wingtips-175-heel-5eacd9343a0db9ad55a00931\">John Fluevog shoes</a>, retail price $200+. I’ve priced it at $75, a great deal considering the shoes have original soles and are barely worn. The offer was for $40 and I countered $50 without thinking. Eventually we settled for $45. $45 is an amazing steal for a pair of shoes from the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/fashion/john-fluevog-shoes.html\">famed Canadian shoe designer</a>.</p>\n<h6>Sunday results</h6>\n<p>For the rest of the evening and early Sunday I checked my phone frequently, hoping another offer or order would arrive. Nothing. I’ve uninstalled the Poshmark app to try to take my mind off it, then reinstalled it to lower the prices across all my listings, including halving the price of that Ted Baker vest from $30 to $15. Finally on Sunday afternoon an order came in. It was $15 for that barely worn Ted Baker vest. With that, I packaged up the shoes and the vest in separate cardboard boxes, saved from previous online purchases.</p>\n<h3>3 lessons I’ve learned on fashion reselling over the weekend</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Selling clothes is tough. It is tough because taking pictures and shipping and pricing is time intensive, plus the market is saturated with too many listings chasing too few eyeballs. Additionally <a href=\"https://support.poshmark.com/s/article/297755057?language=en_US\">Poshmark takes a fee: 20%</a> really cuts into the profit. <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/fees-credits-invoices/selling-fees?id=4364\">eBay reportedly takes 13%</a>, and I’ve cross-posted the higher end items there. No buyers yet.</li>\n<li>A smaller, decluttered closet is a happier closet, whereas a large, full walk-in closet is recipe for analysis paralysis. I’d rather have a smaller closet where the clothes are being worn in a monthly, if not weekly basis. It’s easier for outfit planning and easier on the wallet, because lower maintainance fees (think cleaning, repairs, storage, …)</li>\n<li>A better ban on clothing shopping is a revised <strong>one in, one out</strong> policy: only buy a piece of clothing when you have sold a piece of clothing. Sounds easy, and it is <em>way harder</em> than it sounds.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I use my <a href=\"https://shepicksuppennies.com/low-ball-poshmark-offers/\">Poshmark account to help declutter my closet</a>, not for any hope of making passive income, or recouping any of the hundreds, if not thousands of dollars I’ve spent on it over the years. I’ll hold myself to the <strong>one in, one out</strong> policy, and see if that naurally arrives at the same result as <a href=\"../shopping-ban\">the shopping ban</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/shopping-experience/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My experience selling clothes on Poshmark over the weekend"}}}}}
