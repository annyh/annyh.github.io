As for skill level, I’ve dipped my toes in <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/\">React Native</a> (a framework for developing native apps) a few weeks before, and have 5+ years of React and JavaScript experience. Here’s how I, a React Native newbie, designed and created a React Native app over one weekend.</p>\n<h3>Video walkthrough of the <a href=\"https://github.com/annyh/quote-app-react-native\">Quotes App</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e7yGb7OFbI\" title=\"Quote app\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/8e7yGb7OFbI/0.jpg\" alt=\"Quote app\"></a></p>\n<h3>1. Be clear about what the app does</h3>\n<p>For research I looked on Google Play to find quote-saving apps, and found them ad-filled and/or sharing-oriented. Instead I wanted a simple, ad-free interface to save interesting quotes by insteresting people. On Friday post dinner I sketched the app’s UI on a paper notebook, and the sketches set the tone for the development on Saturday.</p>\n<h3>2. Keep the UI simple</h3>\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://react-native-elements.github.io/react-native-elements/docs/overview.html\">react-native-elements</a> for the UI, including a ListView and ButtonGroup. For navigation I used <a href=\"https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/\">react-navigation’s bottom tabs</a> because tabs are faster to access than the collapsible sidebar.</p>\n<h3>3. Reuse code</h3>\n<p>To get quotes I used this <a href=\"https://goodquotesapi.herokuapp.com/#/developer\">Heroku app derived from Goodreads</a>. For data storage I used <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/asyncstorage.html\">AsyncStorage</a>, which stores data on the phone. <a href=\"https://dev.to/amanhimself/what-is-asyncstorage-in-react-native-4af4\">AsyncStorage has a 6MB limit</a> and it’s not a deal-breaker since I’m prototyping and storing short strings. I could have gone with <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/\">Firebase</a> or another database, but given the tight deadline, I reused the AsyncStorage save/delete code, mostly from <a href=\"https://github.com/mahmudahsan/todos-react-reactnative/tree/master/mobile/model\">this repo</a>. </p>\n<h3>4. Some UI decisions are made midway</h3>\n<p>Midway through Saturday I thought about and added a <strong>link to the authors’ Wikipedia page</strong>, since the URL structure is predictable for most English authors. This makes the authors’ backgrounds easy to access. Additionally I noticed how taxing it is for the user to come up with a new search for quotes. So I added the search by <strong>random tag</strong> feature. The <strong>random tag</strong> is one of <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/career/documents/my-career-path-activities/values-exercise.pdf\">100 possible values</a>. Randomization lowers the barriers to discover more interesting quotes.</p>\n<h3>5. Track to dos to work briskly</h3>\n<p>I jot down development tasks in the <a href=\"https://github.com/annyh/quote-app-react-native/blob/master/readme.md#todo\">readme.md</a> so I can pick up where I left off. Also typing out the tasks clarifies the steps for progress.</p>\n<h3>That’s a wrap!</h3>\n<p>It was a productive weekend, with enough time leftover to take <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e7yGb7OFbI\">a video</a> and write up this blog post. The <a href=\"https://github.com/annyh/quote-app-react-native\">source code is here</a>. It still has <a href=\"https://github.com/annyh/quote-app-react-native/blob/master/readme.md#todo\">some to dos</a>, so I can pick it up during the week, or another weekend :)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Creating a React Native app over a weekend","date":"May 17, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/first-react-native-app/","previous":{"html":"<p>I’m admist a self-imposed <a href=\"../shopping-ban\">shopping ban</a>. During this past month I’ve improved at controlling my spend. I haven’t bought any clothing online for almost two weeks, and don’t feel the urge to buy now. Here are 8 tips to curb online spending.</p>\n<h3>1. Find a new hobby</h3>\n<p>My former hobby was buying upscale clothing at a reasonable price. Over time, snapping up deals depleted my bank account and overflowed my closet. Eventually I realized my research skills could be put to better use. Nowadays I develop mobile apps as a hobby, because I know the importance of a good user interface in getting people to do what you want. I will blog more on my <a href=\"../quotes-app\">first Android app, created with react-native</a>.</p>\n<h3>2. Try selling the items</h3>\n<p><em>I can always resell it</em> was one of my favorite excuses to justify a new purchase. To experience reselling I’ve started <a href=\"../shopping-experience\">selling items on Poshmark</a>, and surprise surprise, clothes are way more <em>difficult to sell</em> than imagined. The many factors at play include the season, fit, trendiness, … Nevertheless selling clothes online is a new hobby of mine, because it is much more intellectually challenging and satisfying than buying.</p>\n<h3>3. Work on your body instead</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/587506-when-i-was-sixteen-i-had-just-two-things-on\">Warren Buffet said: if you only had one car, you’d baby that car. The same thing can be said about your body</a>. We each have only one body, it is the foundation of every outfit, so we need to take care of it! To stay fit while staying inside I’ve resorted to eating baby carrots (they are sweet and filling) and doing an hour of cardio each day including jumping jacks and pushups. I love exercising right after a meal because exercise necessitates smaller and healthier meals. If you want to look good in any outfit, work that bod!</p>\n<h3>4. Journal why you want to buy that item</h3>\n<p>Put the pen to paper and dig deep. For me, I digged trench coats with leather sleeves. Why? Because it stood out and exerted authority. Knowing that I want to stand out and exert authority, I amassed technical skills to stand out, and volunteered for leadership positions to gain authority. This exercise is very elucidating and can be more rewarding than shopping. It’s also free!</p>\n<h3>5. Realize the carrying cost of each item</h3>\n<p>Owning an item is not just coughing up the purchase price. Over the duration of ownership there’s cleaning cost, tailoring cost, mending cost, and selling/donation cost. With a large overflowing closet, the amount quickly adds up. Hence a small closet is good for your wallet.</p>\n<h3>6. Donate half of your closet</h3>\n<p>Take a large garbage bag and fill it with unworn clothes, donate it, then revel in the reclaimed spaciousness. Donating items is the fastest way to declutter, and decluttering feels great because it lifts weight from your closet, mind, and wallet (see previous point).</p>\n<h3>7. Prioritize buying other things</h3>\n<p>What can you do with $125 extra per month? Instead of shopping you can save for a trip, or buy other items such as books. $125 worth of books gives greater joy than most $125 worth of clothing, and books have lower carrying cost. They don’t need dry cleaning, and are easier to gift than clothes :)</p>\n<h3>Give these tips a try!</h3>\n<p>These are the tips I’m working with, and they are working. Now when I see a desirable item I examine <em>why the item appeals</em> to me, then <em>prioritize</em> the item amongst what to purchase. This means less purchases and a less cluttered mind and closet. Try these tips and they can work for you too!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/curb-online-spending/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"8 tips to curb spending"}},"next":{"html":"<p><em>To create more than to consume</em> is a mindset I adopted because creation is more fulfilling than consumption. I’m one month into creating more and here is what I’ve done, what’s working, and the challenges encountered so far.</p>\n<h3>What am I creating?</h3>\n<p><em>To create more than to consume</em> led to some habit changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instead of <strong>reading</strong> blog posts/comics, <strong>write</strong> and <a href=\"https://github.com/annyh/annyh.github.io\">publish my own</a></li>\n<li>Instead of using ready-built apps, <a href=\"../quotes-app\">build an mobile app</a></li>\n<li>Instead of <strong>buying</strong> clothes, <a href=\"../shopping-experience\">sell what I have</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Benefits</h3>\n<p>What are the benefits of those changes?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Memorable experiences</strong>: everyday is exciting because I created a blog post/comic/app </li>\n<li><strong>Faster skill development</strong>: creating apps necessitate just in time learning, and can lead to additional income streams</li>\n<li><strong>Healthier habits</strong>: to accomplish all these while employed, I eat smaller, healthier meals to keep up the energy, and take exercise breaks to recharge</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\n<p>Creating is more challenging than consuming, and it is worth the challenge:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consumption is easier</strong>, yet creation is more fulfilling</li>\n<li><strong>Creating is too time consuming</strong>, and the results are more rewarding </li>\n<li><strong>The creation is ugly</strong>; be aware of implicit comparisons, they are unfair and unproductive </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Methods</h3>\n<p>Here are my 3 ways of creation, and their purpose:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create apps</strong>. Start as weekend projects</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog posts</strong>. To chronicle why, the what, and the how</li>\n<li><strong>Comics</strong>. Some thoughts are more impactful with words <em>and</em> pictures</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Metrics</h3>\n<p>How to measure daily productivity? </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong># of pages written</strong>: whenever I put the pen to paper thoughts pour out. This is the raw material. I target 6 pages of original writing, excluding notes</li>\n<li><strong># of blog posts published</strong>: shaping the raw material into clear thoughts</li>\n<li><strong># of comics created</strong>: this necessitates drawing, a different and more concise medium than words alone</li>\n<li><strong># of git commits</strong>? to show growing coding skills, but quantity doesn’t imply quantity</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Can consumption fuel creation?</h3>\n<p>Mindful consumption can lead to quality creation. The key is to time-bound consumption and specify a clear deliverable.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Books</strong>: reading standing up makes me read faster. I also note down key points, which can jumpstart a blog post/app/comic</li>\n<li><strong>Research to write blog posts</strong>: ie. top 10 female tech bloggers to learn from</li>\n<li><strong>App UX</strong>: what are the similar published apps? Which features to refine and build?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That is how I’m creating more, what about you? Do you enjoy creating more than consuming?
