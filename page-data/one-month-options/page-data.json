By July 1st I’ve made 15% annualized profit. Here is what happened.</p>\n<h3>Goal: profit from short term market volatility from COVID</h3>\n<p>I limited my stock selection to stocks hardest hit by COVID, whose prices are hovering near 52 week lows. I want to own these stocks long term, further narrowing the selection. The two stocks with liquid enough options are Simon Property Property group (SPG) the REIT, and Alaska Airlines (ALK). I’m long term bullish on malls, especially for tourist destinations, and I enjoyed myself so much on Alaska Airlines that I almost didn’t make it off of the plane once. </p>\n<h3>Options strategy</h3>\n<p>For both stocks I’m long-term bullish, short-term bearish. Since I’m predicting the stocks to go sideways or drop slightly, I decided to sell puts. I sold puts with the lowest strike prices that return a 30+% annualized profit. I checked the positions daily and chronicled every trade in Google docs, along with the rationale, for future learning and reference.</p>\n<h3>Key events</h3>\n<p><strong>June 15th, 2020</strong>: I bought naked puts on SPG and ALK for the JUNE weekly, with the strike price of $65 while SPG was around $70, and $30 strike price for ALK with the stock price around $37. I bought weekly because I wanted to see the options expire worthless and fast. Profitability was not a concern here, and no buy back orders were placed since the options were meant to expire.  </p>\n<p><strong>June 19th, 2020</strong>: the SPG puts were in the money and converted to shares. I was ok with that; $65 minus premiums felt low compared to SPG’s historical price. I put a limit loss on it at $62; very tight in hindsight, but the market can turn turn sharply. The ALK put expired and I kept the premium. I purchased July monthlies for both stocks, this time with $55 strike price for SPG.</p>\n<p><strong>June 26th 2020</strong>: both stocks dropped due to a reported increase in COVID cases. SPG tumbled to slightly below $62, triggering the STOP order. Both July puts lost value as the underlying stock prices dropped. </p>\n<p><strong>June 28, 2020</strong> <em>Sunday</em>: I placed the orders to roll the July puts to August, getting more credit upfront and buying time. On Monday the orders were executed, I added the LIMIT orders to buy back those puts at 50% gain.</p>\n<p><strong>July 1, 2020</strong> Limit orders to buy back SPG and ALK were executed. Pocketed 15% profit, since th sell orders were placed at 30% expected profit and were closed at half of that.</p>\n<h3>Lessons learned</h3>\n<p>Focusing on <strong>a few positions</strong> is key; with just two stocks and a few positions to monitor, I only needed to check the portfolio once a day.\n<strong>Position sizing</strong> is also important: I was tempted to go with a bigger position size since that means collecting more premiums up front, but that can lead to large losses if the market turns against the prediction (and it did). I only ordered contracts for how many stocks I would be comfortable owning, which was a dozen for SPG and ten for ALK.</p>\n<p>Overall it was a great experience dipping my feet into options. It felt good making money while the market went sideways, which I didn’t do as a buy and hold investor. I’m now sitting in paper cash and looking at whether to continue with SPG and ALK, or go into other battered stocks.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How I netted 15% profit in 2 weeks trading options","date":"July 01, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/one-month-options/","previous":{"html":"<p>While conversing about the <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2020-06-22/trump-to-suspend-some-foreign-worker-visas-through-end-of-the-year\">suspension of foreign worker visas</a>, a friend remarked instead of blocking out skilled immigrants, it would be better to reform the education system to lessen the need of skilled immigrants. We agreed that’s tough to tackle without forcing students to choose certain professions. Here’s two proposed courses that would actually benefit anyone, regardless of the profession. </p>\n<h3>How to make money from money</h3>\n<p>The traditional education system prepares people to become workers in corporate America. High income workers are seen as successes, the embodiment of the American dream. The high costs of being a high income worker is conveniently omitted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>high salaries tend to congregate in high cost cities, ie. San Francisco, New York City, Seattle, … </li>\n<li>income taxes penalize the high income earners; since that is the only stream of revenue for most people, that’s a big cut from the paycheck</li>\n<li>high salary jobs in the private sector are vulnerable to layoffs </li>\n<li>if the demand for the job decreases, the income stream may dry up  </li>\n<li>high salary white collar positions often require an education, and the <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education-postsecondary/reports/2019/06/12/470893/addressing-1-5-trillion-federal-student-loan-debt/\">$1.5 trillion of cumulative federal student loan debt</a> can mean decade-long payments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Combine all of the above and you have the <strong>working rich</strong>; people with <strong>high income and low net worth</strong>. Additionally these people are <strong>time poor</strong>, and they fuss over a car or vacation more than learning how to manage money. The average joe never learns how to make money from money once they enter the rat race.</p>\n<p>To target these time-poor people, scams abound. <em>Get rich quick from the stock market! Pick these stocks!</em> <a href=\"https://www.tradeciety.com/24-statistics-why-most-traders-lose-money/\">Most people lose money trading</a>. Others don’t trade; they park their retirment income in the stock market, then panic sell when the market corrects. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrich/2016/02/29/warren-buffett-explains-why-over-time-stocks-go-up/#5cb66baf1393\">The stock market goes up long term</a>, but most people are concerned with the superficials (the company stock went down today by $23!) and not with the bigger picture. </p>\n<h4>Proposed course content:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/stock-market/\">Why the stock market exists</a></li>\n<li>Asset allocation for immediate, medium term needs, including how much to save for a cash cushion</li>\n<li>Economic cycles, ie. what goes up comes down, and vice versa</li>\n<li>How and when to buy stocks with a discount, without time travel </li>\n<li>How to identify quality information from the media</li>\n<li>How to test profit strategies without blowing big amounts of real money</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The goal is for people to not fear the stock market, rather to see it as a congregation of speculators. Ideally the course also teaches students to partake in the market in ways that agree with their needs; this may be a follow up course.</p>\n<h3>How to start, grow, and end a long term relationship</h3>\n<p>Schools don’t want to teach this topic because it is almost purely soft skill, however it has huge payoffs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A couple can share the bill, including utility, groceries, Internet, rent/mortgage</li>\n<li>If one person gets laid off, the other person might cover the costs</li>\n<li>Time savings from not going to bars, pubs, or other places to scout for partners</li>\n<li>Increased perceived social value among peers</li>\n<li>Share memories over the years</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is little structured help for this kind of relationship; instead the schools offer advice on resumes and interviews. I suggest <em>we need as much help, if not more, with personal relationships as with professional ones.</em></p>\n<p>What is the cost of not having this knowledge? Badly executed <a href=\"https://thoughtcatalog.com/jacob-geers/2015/07/6-real-breakups-that-end-with-grisly-murder/\">breakups end in death</a>. Another consequence is the pickup industry targeting <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gyk37y/pickup-artist-study-rachel-oneill-seduction-book\">ordinary men who believe women can be gamed, persuaded, or coerced into sex</a>. If the peddled advice doesn’t work, the industry peddles more courses to <em>make it work</em>, but fails because dating is hard. Among different types of dating, the long term relationship is especially hard because the goal is to <a href=\"https://thestripe.com/why-dating-should-be-messy/\">have a meaningful connection with someone you respect, admire, and the desire to build something great together</a>. It is wiser to see the person as someone with needs, wants, and decisons, and work on the relationship together for maximum health, emotional, and financial benefits. Instead of focusing on the details such as setting up online dating profiles, this course allows learners to see the forest, not just the trees.</p>\n<h4>Proposed course content:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Define what you are looking for in a partner and the type of relationship</li>\n<li>Ways to meet and evaluate candidates </li>\n<li>How to discuss, set, and reinforce boundaries</li>\n<li>When to move on from a relationship</li>\n<li>How to move on from a relationship</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are the two skills that anyone can benefit from, regardless of profession. Taking these two courses would go a long way to educate people on two necessary skills in this fast-changing world.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/two-skills/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Two classes that need be taught in schools"}},"next":{"html":"<p>Active trading has a bad reputation lately. Why not just buy an index fund and forget it? Even <a href=\"https://lifestyletrading101.com/warren-buffetts-best-investment-advice-buy-index-funds/?\">Warren Buffet advocates the S&#x26;P500 index for most people</a>.</p>\n<h3>What I learned from a good investment advisor</h3>\n<p>When I was a university student in Canada in 2013 I bought a mutual fund mirroring the predominant Canadian index, hoping for the often-promised <a href=\"https://www.thesimpledollar.com/investing/stocks/where-does-7-come-from-when-it-comes-to-long-term-stock-returns/\">7% average gain</a>. When I checked 1.5 years later the gain was only 2%. </p>\n<p>“What happened? Why are the gains so low?” I asked the investment advisor. I was still in university, and what she said stuck with me, after I’ve forgotten most of the finance class.</p>\n<p>“You bought high in the 52 week range”, she said. The relatively stable Canadian stock market didn’t rally much because it is mostly energy and finance sectors. “There are other mutual funds with more aggressive growth, would you like to see?”   </p>\n<p>“Yes!” I said. She showed me a mutual fund that instead of the 2% gain, had posted <em>45% gains</em> in the last year. “What is in <em>that mutual fund?</em>”</p>\n<p>She showed me the prospectus. It had 50%+ concentration in US stocks. Furthermore the fund has benefited from the USD’s appreciation against the Canadian dollar.</p>\n<p>I was dumbfounded. First, I was thrilled with the great wealth of information available publicly on the Internet, that I can tap into to make better investment decisions. Second, I was slighly peeved that this was not covered in the Introduction to Finance class. Instead of continuing with the passive fund,  I sold and began to teach myself how to actively trade. I still buy and sell index funds opportunistically: when the stock market goes up the indexes go up; when the market is down buy something to profit from the upswing.</p>\n<h3>The goal is to actively trade stocks and options to:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Make money when the market goes sideways, then the funds barely move</li>\n<li>Hedge the concentrated positions </li>\n<li>Generate a bit of income, preferably 15%+ annually</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Why 15%?</em> Because I need to have a threshold to place my trades, and if I can achieve 15% annual growth that means <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/rule72.htm\">doubling the money</a> every 5 years, instead of the 10 years with the average 7% stock market returns.  </p>\n<h3>How I haven’t blown up my bank account (yet)</h3>\n<p>As a business student turned engineer I set some parameters for myself. After all, Warren Buffet said the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffetts-investing-rule-no-154251030.html\">#1 investing rule is: never lose money</a>. To this end I:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Trade infrequently: no day trading </li>\n<li>Journal every entry: what’s the rationale behind the trade? Ie. did I buy for potential capital gains, or is it mostly a dividend play? Is it a long term position or a short term one? What’s the exit and the <a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/stop-loss-order/\">stop loss</a>? </li>\n<li>Aim to buy quality stocks on sale: use limit orders to buy S&#x26;P 500 companies around price supports, preferably around their 52 week low </li>\n<li>Stick to what I’ve tested out on paper trade: sell naked puts, and maybe covered calls</li>\n<li>Focus on tax efficiency: moved most of my money into tax advantaged or tax deferred accounts</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In 2020 in 2 weeks I’ve made $10k paper trading options which is 5% of the paper trade portfolio, and since March I’ve made 20% in real money with a mutual fund tracking the Nasdaq index. I chose Nasdaq because it contains the biggest names in tech, and the work from home phenomenom benefits them.</p>\n<h3>Investing as a potential revenue stream</h3>\n<p>I am fortunate that I have an engineering job with a good salary, however no job is permanent. I am building out this skill set in my twenties to develop a revenue stream that hopefully will support my frugal lifestyle.</p>\n<p><strong>Next steps: learn more about</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Trading USD/CAD pair on forex</li>\n<li>Bonds: when to buy?</li>\n<li>Futures, especially how to provide downside protection when the market goes bonkers?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I love learning the fundamentals via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_simulator\">paper trading</a>, then applying them in real life. </p>\n<p>Looking forward to more investing adventures.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/active-trading/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why I actively trade"}}}}}
