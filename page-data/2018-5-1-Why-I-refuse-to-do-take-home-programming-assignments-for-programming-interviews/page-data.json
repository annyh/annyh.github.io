Because marketing makes technology sexy, the same way Ginger Rogers made Fred Astaire sexy. Also no one is doing marketing for my team yet. Besides me. Prime time for learning. </p>\n<p>Here is a sample of what I did for my team in 2017, outside of coding. Did I mention all of these are volunteer work, aka no one asked me to do it? </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Conceived and organized a <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/visualizemydata/events/238756680/\">meetup</a> to gather user feedback about our open source project <a href=\"https://github.com/salesforce/refocus\">refocus</a></li>\n<li>Conceived and organized the knowledge sharing session between Site Reliability Tools in Salesforce and the equivalent team at Lyft</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPBK-qaGFKI\">Spoke and demoed</a> our open source project <a href=\"https://github.com/salesforce/refocus\">refocus</a> at two conferences</li>\n<li>Procured board games at our workspace to enliven the space and get creative juices flowing</li>\n<li>Organized and stepped in last minute to present <a href=\"https://github.com/salesforce/refocus\">refocus</a> at the internal Tech Talk, and demoed its sky-is-the-limit customizability</li>\n<li>Organized the inaugural hackathon at our department</li>\n<li>Wrote and published the blog post on <a href=\"https://engineering.salesforce.com/https-medium-com-annyhe-nerdy-new-years-resolution-share-your-technical-project-at-a-conference-5c2719d3684c\">how to promote technology projects at conferences</a>, published on Salesforce Engineering blog.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Notice a pattern? These are all transferable skills that I can apply elsewhere in my career. It also helps that I have the team’s and the management’s support: my team attended the first conference talk, and the company paid for the second conference trip. My manager’s manager congratulated me on the published blog post, and the Lyft knowledge share was also mentioned at the VP level. What I do makes our team and the company look good.</p>\n<p>If you were wondering whether I slacked off at my regular job, I did not. These are all on top of regular coding work. I also stepped in and remediated the void created by the departure of a senior developer. I acquire soft skills on top of technical chops. </p>\n<p>Do I expect each one of my efforts to be rewarded by the management? That would be nice. However it is my career that I am building, and nothing beats learning on the job. </p>","fields":{"slug":"/2018-1-6-going-above-and-beyond-in-2017/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What do I do besides writing code at work?"}},"next":{"html":"<p>In the spirit of learning what’s new and latest in the world of two-sided markets, I explored online platforms that connect employers and software engineers. Hiring platforms such as <a href=\"https://hired.com\">Hired</a> and <a href=\"https://triplebyte.com/candidates\">TripleByte</a> all tackle the problem differently. Furthermore it’s also good to practice coding questions on <a href=\"https://leetcode.com\">LeetCode</a>. Here’s some lowlights and highlights of my exploration on LeetCode, Hired and a short fling with TripleByte.</p>\n<h1>Experiences</h1>\n<p>The most annoying thing: each online job seeker platform have a lengthy separate setup time and upkeep: Hired requires vigilant upkeep to accept interview invites, and Triplebyte demands answering a quiz plus additional programming excises. These are taxing on the job seeker, who, if living in the Bay Area and is well-connected, already has many other recruiters sending phone requests to in their inbox.</p>\n<p><strong>Hired</strong></p>\n<p>There is little differentiation between companies when they hire through a platform: any posting looking for a software engineer of a certain domain asks for a similar set of technologies, hence all the companies look similar.\nThe companies I interviewed with on Hired are venture-funded startups, and while I enjoyed interviewing with them and received offers, I turned them down to take a different position within Salesforce, my then-employer.\nInitial non-technical phone screens were time intensive, and it’s not really clear what is the value-add to the job seeker.\nTake home exercises weeds out candidates who don’t do free exercise, or who are interviewing with multiple companies. You can read about <a href=\"../Why-I-refuse-to-do-take-home-programming-assignments-for-programming-interviews/\">my stance in take-home exercises here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>TripleByte</strong></p>\n<p>The major selling point of this platform is the job seeker goes directly to tech screens with the companies, skipping the non-technical initial call. Before all that, the job seeker has to clear a programming exercise, then a programming interview with TripleByte. While the programming exercise was short and sweet, the interview was long, around 90 minutes, and involved me live-coding a UI component while screen-sharing, plus quizzes on front end technologies including CSS. It was good preparation for future technical interviews. Even though I did not advance to the next step, it was a positive experience, since the detailed feedback on what could have been better was valued. Since most interviews don’t even provide feedback, TripleByte came out ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>LeetCode</strong></p>\n<p>I am a big fan of crunching through programming exercises, and LeetCode especially shines when you want to become confident for technical interviews. These are core Computing Science programming questions, including how to implement a tree, how to balance it, etc. Preparing for these fundamental questions is essential, as I found out during my Microsoft Software Engineer interview. I’ve through the Easy and Medium exercises in JavaScript, and given the quirkiness of the language, developed some nice talks as a result, especially <a href=\"https://dev.to/heroku/javascript-quirks-numbers-edition-3ppa\">my talk on JavaScript Numbers</a>.</p>\n<h1>Highlights</h1>\n<p><strong>Hired</strong></p>\n<p>I liked the breakdown of which industry the company is in, and the number of engineers; the latter differentiates the startups from more mature companies.\nInterviewing mainly with startups, I enjoyed the direct access to CEO/CTOs. It was great to pick their brains on what the startup life is like, and whether I’d like to be in their shoes.</p>\n<p><strong>TripleByte</strong></p>\n<p>Big fan of taking the practice programming interview, since the feedback is valuable.</p>\n<p><strong>LeetCode</strong></p>\n<p>I love the gamification of getting points for completing problems, and seeing myself advance on the leaderboard. Also enjoy the breadth of programming exercises. A good platform to review core Computing Science problems, and/or to learn about the <a href=\"https://dev.to/heroku/javascript-quirks-numbers-edition-3ppa\">quirks of the language</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2019-4-22-swe-hiring-platoform/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Experiences with Hired, TripleByte, and LeetCode"}}}}}
