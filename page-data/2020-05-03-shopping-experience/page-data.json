I’m one month into creating more and here is what I’ve done, what’s working, and the challenges encountered so far.</p>\n<h3>What am I creating?</h3>\n<p><em>To create more than to consume</em> led to some habit changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instead of <strong>reading</strong> blog posts/comics, <strong>write</strong> and <a href=\"https://github.com/annyh/annyh.github.io\">publish my own</a></li>\n<li>Instead of using ready-built apps, <a href=\"../quotes-app\">build an mobile app</a></li>\n<li>Instead of <strong>buying</strong> clothes, <a href=\"../shopping-experience\">sell what I have</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Benefits</h3>\n<p>What are the benefits of those changes?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Memorable experiences</strong>: everyday is exciting because I created a blog post/comic/app </li>\n<li><strong>Faster skill development</strong>: creating apps necessitate just in time learning, and can lead to additional income streams</li>\n<li><strong>Healthier habits</strong>: to accomplish all these while employed, I eat smaller, healthier meals to keep up the energy, and take exercise breaks to recharge</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\n<p>Creating is more challenging than consuming, and it is worth the challenge:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consumption is easier</strong>, yet creation is more fulfilling</li>\n<li><strong>Creating is too time consuming</strong>, and the results are more rewarding </li>\n<li><strong>The creation is ugly</strong>; be aware of implicit comparisons, they are unfair and unproductive </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Methods</h3>\n<p>Here are my 3 ways of creation, and their purpose:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create apps</strong>. Start as weekend projects</li>\n<li><strong>Write blog posts</strong>. To chronicle why, the what, and the how</li>\n<li><strong>Comics</strong>. Some thoughts are more impactful with words <em>and</em> pictures</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Metrics</h3>\n<p>How to measure daily productivity? </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong># of pages written</strong>: whenever I put the pen to paper thoughts pour out. This is the raw material. I target 6 pages of original writing, excluding notes</li>\n<li><strong># of blog posts published</strong>: shaping the raw material into clear thoughts</li>\n<li><strong># of comics created</strong>: this necessitates drawing, a different and more concise medium than words alone</li>\n<li><strong># of git commits</strong>? to show growing coding skills, but quantity doesn’t imply quantity</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Can consumption fuel creation?</h3>\n<p>Mindful consumption can lead to quality creation. The key is to time-bound consumption and specify a clear deliverable.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Books</strong>: reading standing up makes me read faster. I also note down key points, which can jumpstart a blog post/app/comic</li>\n<li><strong>Research to write blog posts</strong>: ie. top 10 female tech bloggers to learn from</li>\n<li><strong>App UX</strong>: what are the similar published apps? Which features to refine and build?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That is how I’m creating more, what about you? Do you enjoy creating more than consuming? Which primary ways do you create? </p>","fields":{"slug":"/2020-5-20-create-more-than-consume/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to create more than consume"}},"next":null}}}
