Here are some of my favorite blog posts from vetted bloggers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jlcollinsnh.com/2012/06/06/why-i-dont-like-investment-advisors/\">Why I don’t like investment advisors</a>. This is the best article on what can go wrong working with an investment advisor. I’m sure there are good advisors out there, but picking a good investment advisor is just as hard, if not harder, than picking good stocks. Also, <strong>no one cares about your money as much as you</strong>.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2016/07/28/ultralearn-diy-1/\">Get started with ultra learning</a>. I’m a big fan of learning quickly and deeply. The biggest takeaway is to prioritize a <strong>direction to learn</strong> instead of sticking to <strong>spefic goals</strong>, since goals change with time. An attack plan and schedule is essential, like what I did with <a href=\"../first-react-native-app/\">creating the React Native app</a>. This post reminds me of <a href=\"https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/05/04/do-the-real-thing/\">do the real thing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2008/10/30/is-reading-making-you-stupid/\">are you reading to procrastinate</a>. I also admire the author Scott H. Young’s <a href=\"https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/articles/s\">vast repository of blog posts organized by topic</a>; it shows dedication. I don’t agree with all of his posts, including this one: <a href=\"https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2015/10/07/strangely-useful-career-advice/\">if you want to be an author, don’t start writing</a>; a published author needs to have connections with publishers, but he/she has to be a prolific writer too. Both the skill and network are essential. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2013/02/05/two-types-of-growth/\">Two types of growth</a>. For example running is logarithmic so the law of diminishing returns apply, while building a business doesn’t have the same plateau. It’s useful to know the different types of growth for prioritization. Another favorite blog post is <a href=\"https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2018/12/04/25-thinking-tools/\">25 thinking models</a> to generate more ideas. More ideas prioritized well means better output.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.moneylab.co/timeline/\">Moneylab timeline</a>. This is the funniest timeline I’ve seen, detailing the author’s startup journey in the last 11 years. This is an inspirational read with concise text and colorful background.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.financialsamurai.com/the-first-million-might-be-the-easiest-how-to-become-a-millionaire-by-30/\">How to amass $1 million by age 30</a>. Very impressed by <strong><a href=\"https://www.financialsamurai.com/\">Financial Samurai’s</a></strong> overview on achieving this milestone, especially since he lived in NYC and San Francisco, two of the most expensive cities in the US. A big goal of mine is to replicate this. Also entertaining read on investing in the stock market: <a href=\"https://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-make-a-lot-of-money-in-the-stock-market/\">How To Make A Lot Of Money In The Stock Market And Still Feel Bad</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://minafi.com/focus-activities\">21 activities to focus on the future</a>. Also great for generating blog post ideas! My favorites are <strong>Set A Monthly Theme</strong> and <strong>List of Your “Why’s” For Financial Independence</strong>. The author is also a web developer, like me. I’m a big fan of his <a href=\"https://minafi.com/investing-mistake\">investment rules and mistakes</a>, because we can learn from others’ investment rules. Another favorite post of his is <a href=\"https://minafi.com/minafi-2017-q3-investment-report\">2017 fall investment report</a>, showing his financial progress over the years with a spending report. I’m always curious how others spend so these were a joy to read.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ournextlife.com/2019/01/07/one-year-lessons/\">Biggest lessons from 1 year in retirement</a>, from a female FIRE blogger. Personal finance is a heavily male-dominated field so it is refreshing to find a female voice. I’m curious about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement\">FIRE community</a> because of their practical and transparent take on money and lifestyle. Favorite learnings include how there are <strong>more hours in the day to spend more</strong>, and how <strong>more time together doesn’t make for instant harmony</strong>, something I’ve learned from being cooped up with my partner during the epidemic. See the <a href=\"https://minafi.com/work-optional-book-review\">book review</a> for exercises from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Work-Optional-Retire-Early-Non-Penny-Pinching/dp/0316450898/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;linkCode=ll1&#x26;tag=minafi0a-20&#x26;linkId=5bd53340cdb9b28f35b1f4c75df0b0ba&#x26;language=en_US\">the author’s book</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/fave-blog-posts/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Personal finance blogs I'm reading during the epidemic"}},"next":{"html":"<p>7 Gigs I did from age 12 to 28, excluding <a href=\"../what-i-do-at-work\">software engineering jobs</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.girlguides.ca/web/GGC/?_ga=2.264388044.271949957.1592773465-1459434870.1592773465\">Girl guide</a> cookies</strong>: $200+ sales. I was 12 years old. The biggest payday was selling in front of Safeway with another Girl Guide. She became the top seller and I was #2. I was surprised how adults didn’t buy cookies to consume; they bought to support the cause</li>\n<li><strong>Paper route</strong>: &#x3C;$100. I took over someone else’s route for two months. I remember the smell of printed ads as I shoved them into the newspaper and  the relaxation of an afternoon stroll in the nearby neighborhood. Too bad the local papers are declining; it was a great starter job</li>\n<li><strong>Babysitting and tutoring</strong>: I tried each just once, taking care of a neighbor’s two children during one evening and making art with another neighbor’s son. Both opportunities were unsolicited; the neighbors knew I was around, and it also helped the building’s most advertised babysitter was 11 years old. Looking back I could have taken the opportunity to expand the business during my college years </li>\n<li><strong>Being a cashier at a restaurant</strong>: $800 overall for part-time summer work, $9/hour. I was hungry at the restaurant; we were allowed unlimited soda and one burger every four hours. I avoided the soda and was too busy to enjoy the burger</li>\n<li><strong>Bagpiper at a funeral</strong>: $250/hour. I played bagpipes for 7 years and performed at a funeral home. It was gratifying to set my rate and get it</li>\n<li><strong>Commissioned muralist</strong>: I was commissioned for $500 by my former elementary school. The painting was appropriate for all ages, set against a backdrop of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Starry_Night\">van Gogh’s Starry Night</a>. This is the only time I was paid for my art; I’ve shown my art at curated galleries without pay</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cutco.com/\"><strong>Sold kitchen knives</strong></a>: >$2000 revenue, &#x3C;$650 take home. As my first gig in university, I rode buses to sell knives to high school teachers. I felt high whenever I made a sale :)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://poshmark.com/\"><strong>Poshmark</strong></a>: $430 take home. Being paid to declutter feels great, especially since Goodwill is closed due to the pandemic. This also taught me to <a href=\"../shopping-ban\">avoid buying more clothes</a>; they are nontrivial to unload</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I love doing self-directed work. Looking forward to turning more gigs into businesses.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/paying-gigs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"7 Gigs I did growing up"}}}}}
