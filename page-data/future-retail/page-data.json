I’ve seen the retail landscape shifting from malls to online, from new to second-hand. Here’s how the retail experience can survive the global covid epidemic and compete with Amazon.</p>\n<h3>The middle market need to partner with the second-hand market</h3>\n<p>Luxury will always be there for people who want the latest flashiest things. Big discount stores like Ross will supply necessities for instant gratification. The second-hand market including online resellers and physical consignment stores will eat into the discretionary middle market; why buy something mass produced, when you can get a unique find at a similar price instead? If the middle market ie. stores like Macy’s and Nordstrom want to keep up, they need to include resellers into their midst. Malls can also benefit from a storefront with second-hand stores ie. theRealReal: the fast-changing nature of reseller’s goods can increase traffic. </p>\n<h3>End of fast fashion???</h3>\n<p>As a value shopper I don’t see the value proposition of fast fashion. The goods are often low quality, the style does not last beyond a season, and it is horrible for the environment. Perhaps some find the price point attractive, but paying a bit more is worth it for a higher quality, more durable good that <em>can be resold</em>.</p>\n<h3>Better fit for clothing or shoes means more $$$</h3>\n<p>High-end stores will measure a potential customer and provide recommendations based on the measurements; storing measurements is easy to do, yet many stores, both online and physical, don’t store them, even though they have an account on the customer. The better the fit, the more the customer will pay. Stores are leaving money on the table because what they sell don’t fit. Physical stores can go even further and provide tailoring service to increase value.</p>\n<h3>Limitations of the online experience</h3>\n<p>Customer service for online storefronts are limited; have a problem with the order? It is chat or email only, which might resolve the issue but provides no opportunity for upsell. Shipping delays means instant gratification becomes delayed, slowing down the positive feedback loop. Shipping is bad for the environment, and the increased costs mean online shopping cost more than thrifting locally. High end customers are willing to pay for a better online experience, such as those who go to Equinox and purchase a Peleton; I’m fascinated by their fervent community who shell out $200+/month for a gym membership, and $2000+ for a bike, with monthly payments for content.</p>\n<h3>Why I’m bullish on physycal storefront</h3>\n<p>Can you imagine Apple selling the $2000 iPhones without a wonderful physical presence? I can’t either. The physical storefront used to be a prerequisite for great service, since positive interactions with the employees can lead to repeat sales and upsell. While online experiences have been catching up (such as Peleton customers), the high-end stores will continue to have a physical presence. Many customers will pay more for a proper fit, and the shopping experience facilitated by a real person.</p>\n<h3>How malls can thrive with locals</h3>\n<p>Similar to hotel chains that offer loyalty programs, the malls can provide a reward program that encourages shopping, exercise, tailoring, and more services bundled together. The more you spend the more you save. The mall can also be a place for people to sell their goods via pop up stores or partnerships with resellers; the fast turnaround of goods and stores means there are more to see per visit.</p>\n<p>The retail landscape seems to change every day, accelerated by the global epidemic. What doesn’t change is good customer service to provide value, such as knowing the customer’s measurements and tailoring for fit. The online experience contiues to evolve upwards into the high end market. The middle market is changing with integrations of indie designers and resellers; it is a tough place to be in, squeezed by the resellers and the low low price of fast fashion. </p>\n<p>Retail is a fast changing space with lots going on. Whatever happens, it won’t be boring.  </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The future of retail, according to a millenial","date":"July 14, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/future-retail/","previous":{"html":"<p>So far in 2020  I’ve run 212 miles over 34 hours. Before Halloween I’m planning to get to 300 miles. I run for health benefits. They include:</p>\n<h3>1. Running reinforces a healthy schedule</h3>\n<p>I get to bed around 11 pm and wake up before 8 am. I run in the morning while the streets are mostly empty. Waking up is tough but feels great; by 9 am I feel ready to tackle the day from a run and a shower.</p>\n<h3>2. Running prompts healthy eating</h3>\n<p>Before I was a fan of large meals, even if I get bogged down after a meal. I used to have multiple heavy meals in a day; it could be 2 slices of pizza or 3 slices of bread smeared with Nutella. Now I eat lighter because I need to run on an empty stomach, so I snack on watermelon and drink plenty of water.  Running while constipated feel like running with a brick; it is particularly bad form of torture.</p>\n<h3>3. Running makes me high</h3>\n<p>During a run I occasionally feel runner’s high; that feeling of gliding through clouds without a care in the world. Running is a time when I’m free of worries, just swinging my arms and pushing off of my feet. Even though I run early in the day, the energy boost lasts throughout the day, hence the 45 minutes to 1 hour of self-induced stress is worth it.</p>\n<h3>4. Achieving a running goal feels great!</h3>\n<p>Whenever I want to keep a habit I set a goal. My initial goal was to run 10km under 1 hour, which I did at the YMCA Chinatown 10k race. The icing on the cake was I also beat my 10km personal best, set when I was 16 years old and a few pounds lighter. Just today I beat my personal best for a 5km, clocking 8:58 miles per hour. Next, I want to run a half marathon under 2 hours; I might have to do this alone or run a virtual race given the epidemic. I also want to increase my mileage this year to 300 miles. Assuming the epidemic does not get much worse, if I run every other day I’ll be able to accomplish the mileage goal by Halloween of 2020. </p>\n<p>I highly encourage running. It is a great way to stay sane and fit during the epidemic.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/running-improve/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How running has improved my life"}},"next":{"html":"<p>During the epidemic, I read up on how to start and succeed as a small business owner. I came across Adam Davidson’s book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Economy-Thriving-Twenty-First-Century/dp/0385353529\">the Passion Economy</a>, on a list of best non-fiction books. Even though it was over 300 pages long I devoured it in one evening. Here are 9 takeaways. </p>\n<h3>1. Figure out why you are interested in the Passion Economy</h3>\n<p>Passion Economy is a term that Adam used to describe profitable niche companies that big companies rarely compete with. Examples included OCHO Candy Inc, a candy with organic materials selling across the US, and <a href=\"https://humu.com/\">Humu</a>, a data-centric business founded by ex-Googlers to incentivize employees to stay longer. Both companies occupy a niche. Ie. OCHO competes against the Mars candy company, and Huhu goes deeper than anonymous data and offers “nudges” curated per employee. </p>\n<p>I’m interested in the Passion Economy because I’m a content creator. I’m curious about how the future of content will be delivered and digested, give the ever shorter content lifecycles and the growing demand for quality entertainment. While there are the big content creators ie. the various streaming platforms, I wonder if there’s a way to bring together writers and moviemakers into a company that produces quality content, year-round.</p>\n<h3>2. There are two kinds of geniuses</h3>\n<p>The first kind are the Albert Einsteins: they make great discoveries, and their discoveries are difficult to understand for the average person. </p>\n<p>The second kind are those who make the incomprehensible comprehensible. </p>\n<p>I aspire to achieve the later kind of genius, by creating content to clarify the complex. An example of what I’ve seen is the <strong>Patriot Act</strong>, a Netflix show starring Hasan Minhaj. Each episode is funny, informative, and goes into political topics such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MykMQfmLIro&#x26;ab_channel=NetflixIsAJoke\">Elections</a> and how <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrKxOnNaGHc&#x26;ab_channel=NetflixIsAJoke\">Corononavirus broke America</a>. I strive to be informative and funny, just like Hasan. </p>\n<h3>3. Separate value creation from value capture</h3>\n<p>Nike creates value by creating products with a large premium through celebrity sponsorships. Then it captures the value by sharing the premium via large advertising spend. This is a high cost, high margin example. The product is not the only deliverable; the consumer also desires the association with sports legends such as Serena Williams.</p>\n<h3>4. Pick your customer and pick your competition</h3>\n<p>To pick your customer, talk to 20 potential customers. See what their reaction to your product is. </p>\n<p>To pick your competition find a niche that is poorly served by large companies. For example a garment manufacturer went after workers who needed fire-tolerant clothing, but whose clothes from DuPont were not breathable. When their workers took off the clothes during summer the companies were fined. Another example is a brush company that sold brushes to a nuclear power plant because its requirements were unfulfilled by cheaper brushes.</p>\n<h3>5. Let the price drive the costs</h3>\n<p>In the Passion economy, much of the cost is in the knowledge, creativity, and time to think. Charge a lot, then earn it. The price should feel good to you. Determine the value by having conversations with customers to see where they can most improve. If they refuse the service, you can ask what they went with instead. This also applies to employees; while the salary is the price, you can pinpoint special projects that only you can execute. The key is to avoid being a commodity because commodities compete on price, and price battles are a losing proposition.</p>\n<h3>6. Change value capture constantly, change value creation slowly</h3>\n<p>Going back to the Nike example. Nike creates sportswear, which is the value creation. It has multiple value capture methods, including creating <a href=\"https://www.nike.com/nike-by-you\">custom shoes</a>. </p>\n<h3>7. Revenue matters less than profit</h3>\n<p>It is refreshing to read a book about non-tech companies. Many tech companies follow a revenue growth policy while ignoring the bottom line. This book follows advice from <a href=\"http://www.jasonblumer.com/\">Jason Blumer</a>, an accountant turned consultant who advises companies to charge high and earn it. This means pursuing a more targeted customer base, forsaking the top line for high margins.  </p>\n<h3>8. Add nudges to increase long-term happiness</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory\">Nudges</a> is a behavioral concept: make the desired behavior easier to do than undesirable behavior. For example, automated contributions to retirement accounts led to more people saving for retirement. </p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://humu.com/\">Humu</a>, an HR data-centric business, the software nudges the manager at the time of the scheduling to pick from a list of available people, instead of asking whoever comes to mind. The managers are also nudged to have career conversations, increasing the likelihood of the frontline staff to stay at the fast-food restaurant longer. Each six-month stay contributes to a 1% bump in the bottom line; given most fast-food chains have a profit margin of 6%, a 1% gain is significant.</p>\n<h3>9. Manager as coach</h3>\n<p>The ideal manager is a coach that understands each team member and helps them achieve their goals. This is easier said than done since each manager is a link in a chain with someone else to answer to. Still, it’s a theory that I agree with and something to aspire to.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Overall I enjoyed Adam Davidson’s book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Economy-Thriving-Twenty-First-Century/dp/0385353529\">the Passion Economy</a>. It gave plenty of examples of how to succeed as a profitable niche company in the twenty-first century. The basic framework asks these four questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What are the things I know how to do</li>\n<li>Who would most benefit from these things?</li>\n<li>How much would they benefit? Quantify the benefit in dollars.</li>\n<li>How can I frame what I do so people can see the benefit and agree to price based on value?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I recommend the book to anyone who wants to study small businesses. It is a fast and informative read.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/asian-fiction/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"9 takeaways from the Passion Economy"}}}}}
