I’ve seen the retail landscape shifting from malls to online, from new to second-hand. Here’s how the retail experience can survive the global covid epidemic and compete with Amazon.</p>\n<h3>The middle market need to partner with the second-hand market</h3>\n<p>Luxury will always be there for people who want the latest flashiest things. Big discount stores like Ross will supply necessities for instant gratification. The second-hand market including online resellers and physical consignment stores will eat into the discretionary middle market; why buy something mass produced, when you can get a unique find at a similar price instead? If the middle market ie. stores like Macy’s and Nordstrom want to keep up, they need to include resellers into their midst. Malls can also benefit from a storefront with second-hand stores ie. theRealReal: the fast-changing nature of reseller’s goods can increase traffic. </p>\n<h3>End of fast fashion???</h3>\n<p>As a value shopper I don’t see the value proposition of fast fashion. The goods are often low quality, the style does not last beyond a season, and it is horrible for the environment. Perhaps some find the price point attractive, but paying a bit more is worth it for a higher quality, more durable good that <em>can be resold</em>.</p>\n<h3>Better fit for clothing or shoes means more $$$</h3>\n<p>High-end stores will measure a potential customer and provide recommendations based on the measurements; storing measurements is easy to do, yet many stores, both online and physical, don’t store them, even though they have an account on the customer. The better the fit, the more the customer will pay. Stores are leaving money on the table because what they sell don’t fit. Physical stores can go even further and provide tailoring service to increase value.</p>\n<h3>Limitations of the online experience</h3>\n<p>Customer service for online storefronts are limited; have a problem with the order? It is chat or email only, which might resolve the issue but provides no opportunity for upsell. Shipping delays means instant gratification becomes delayed, slowing down the positive feedback loop. Shipping is bad for the environment, and the increased costs mean online shopping cost more than thrifting locally. High end customers are willing to pay for a better online experience, such as those who go to Equinox and purchase a Peleton; I’m fascinated by their fervent community who shell out $200+/month for a gym membership, and $2000+ for a bike, with monthly payments for content.</p>\n<h3>Why I’m bullish on physycal storefront</h3>\n<p>Can you imagine Apple selling the $2000 iPhones without a wonderful physical presence? I can’t either. The physical storefront used to be a prerequisite for great service, since positive interactions with the employees can lead to repeat sales and upsell. While online experiences have been catching up (such as Peleton customers), the high-end stores will continue to have a physical presence. Many customers will pay more for a proper fit, and the shopping experience facilitated by a real person.</p>\n<h3>How malls can thrive with locals</h3>\n<p>Similar to hotel chains that offer loyalty programs, the malls can provide a reward program that encourages shopping, exercise, tailoring, and more services bundled together. The more you spend the more you save. The mall can also be a place for people to sell their goods via pop up stores or partnerships with resellers; the fast turnaround of goods and stores means there are more to see per visit.</p>\n<p>The retail landscape seems to change every day, accelerated by the global epidemic. What doesn’t change is good customer service to provide value, such as knowing the customer’s measurements and tailoring for fit. The online experience contiues to evolve upwards into the high end market. The middle market is changing with integrations of indie designers and resellers; it is a tough place to be in, squeezed by the resellers and the low low price of fast fashion. </p>\n<p>Retail is a fast changing space with lots going on. Whatever happens, it won’t be boring.  </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The future of retail, according to a millenial","date":"July 14, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/future-retail copy/","previous":{"html":"<p>This weekend I finally tackled the issue of how to invest a $15000 USD in a tax-deferred account. Tax-deferred means the gains are tax-free until withdrawal. The account comes with these constraints:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I cannot trade options in it; this is a temporary constraint</li>\n<li>I don’t want to replicate positions from other accounts, which are heavy with tech stocks, the Nasdaq index, and an airline stock</li>\n<li>I’m ok monitoring the account weekly, then monthly after establishing a position</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given the above, here are some ideas and thoughts on each:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Trade <strong>tech stocks</strong> since they are volatile and this is a tax-deferred account, but I’m already heavy in tech and want diversification</li>\n<li>Trade <strong>airline stocks</strong> since they are volatile and this is a tax-deferred account, but I already have a position with an airline and want diversification</li>\n<li>Buy and hold <strong>S&#x26;P 500/Russell 2000/Nasdaq 100</strong>, but I already have large positions with index funds</li>\n<li><strong>Buy bonds</strong>, but the interest rates are at all-time lows. The return is simply not there, though better than sitting in cash</li>\n<li><strong>Sit in cash</strong>; not the best option since the brokerage pays less than 1% interest; there are better returns </li>\n<li><strong>Buy undervalued S&#x26;P 500 dividend stocks</strong>. This is what I did with <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HD/\">Home Depot</a> and <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL\">Apple</a>, back in 2017 when they were on sale from a potential trade war between the US and China. No trade war happened yet and the stocks have doubled in price</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’m ok with buying stocks since I have a long time horizon and a high-risk tolerance. While the idea of buying undervalued is good, executing the idea is challenging. Let’s tackle it one question at a time.</p>\n<p><strong>Which undervalued stock to buy?</strong></p>\n<p>Looking at S&#x26;P 500 stocks that are near their 52-week lows, the mall REIT sector has barely recovered. Specifically, SPG, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPG/\">Simon Property Group</a>, the largest real estate company in the US, is trading at 9.9x PE. It owns roughly 200 malls across the country, many in tourism spots. I’m bullish on malls getting back on their feet especially in tourism hotspots, and SPG pays a quarterly dividend with an impressive yield of 8% while we wait. Its annual revenues have increased in the <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SPG/simon-property/revenue\">single digits until the epidemic struck</a>. Its net profit margin as of March 31, 2020, is a healthy 35.2%.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes the stock risky?</strong></p>\n<p>A worsening global epidemic will lead to a delay in mall reopening. Even if the malls reopen, would sales per square foot bounce back to February 2020 levels? How would traditionally brick and mortar stores compete after the epidemic forced shoppers to buy online? Additionally, SPG is in the talks to buy <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/30/heres-why-the-biggest-us-mall-owner-might-want-to-buy-jc-penney.html\">JC Penny</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/06/simon-property-group-part-of-company-bidding-for-a.aspx\">Lucky Brand</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/investing/brooks-brothers-bankruptcy-buyout-offers-simon-property\">Brooks Brothers</a>. It might overpay for one or all three. It is also suing its tenant Gap for <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/gap-stock-simon-property-rent-covid-19-malls-51591277317\">$69.5 million in rent and other charges</a>. Its net income has also decreased in 2019 by 13.89% before the epidemic worsened the drop to 15.95%. </p>\n<p><strong>What is the entry price, and how much to buy?</strong></p>\n<p>Support is $55 and stock price is $65.  I will use a limit order of $60 and use half of the account and buy a multiple of 100. Will check back in another week to see whether it has been executed. If it has not I will either wait or purchase another stock.</p>\n<p><strong>How long to hold it for and what is the planned exit point?</strong></p>\n<p>Since this stock pays dividends quarterly with an annual distribution of $5.2 which is an annual yield of 8.1%, as long as its fundamentals are sound and there are no more ideas for the money, I’ll keep the position with a stop loss of 10%. </p>\n<p>Though if SPG pops back near 52-week highs at 2.5x of its current price I might consider selling it. Hopefully, we will be out of the epidemic then.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/invest-15000/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to invest $15,000 USD in a tax deferred account"}},"next":{"html":"<p>So far in 2020  I’ve run 212 miles over 34 hours. Before Halloween I’m planning to get to 300 miles. I run for health benefits. They include:</p>\n<h3>1. Running reinforces a healthy schedule</h3>\n<p>I get to bed around 11 pm and wake up before 8 am. I run in the morning while the streets are mostly empty. Waking up is tough but feels great; by 9 am I feel ready to tackle the day from a run and a shower.</p>\n<h3>2. Running prompts healthy eating</h3>\n<p>Before I was a fan of large meals, even if I get bogged down after a meal. I used to have multiple heavy meals in a day; it could be 2 slices of pizza or 3 slices of bread smeared with Nutella. Now I eat lighter because I need to run on an empty stomach, so I snack on watermelon and drink plenty of water.  Running while constipated feel like running with a brick; it is particularly bad form of torture.</p>\n<h3>3. Running makes me high</h3>\n<p>During a run I occasionally feel runner’s high; that feeling of gliding through clouds without a care in the world. Running is a time when I’m free of worries, just swinging my arms and pushing off of my feet. Even though I run early in the day, the energy boost lasts throughout the day, hence the 45 minutes to 1 hour of self-induced stress is worth it.</p>\n<h3>4. Achieving a running goal feels great!</h3>\n<p>Whenever I want to keep a habit I set a goal. My initial goal was to run 10km under 1 hour, which I did at the YMCA Chinatown 10k race. The icing on the cake was I also beat my 10km personal best, set when I was 16 years old and a few pounds lighter. Just today I beat my personal best for a 5km, clocking 8:58 miles per hour. Next, I want to run a half marathon under 2 hours; I might have to do this alone or run a virtual race given the epidemic. I also want to increase my mileage this year to 300 miles. Assuming the epidemic does not get much worse, if I run every other day I’ll be able to accomplish the mileage goal by Halloween of 2020. </p>\n<p>I highly encourage running. It is a great way to stay sane and fit during the epidemic.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/running-improve/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How running has improved my life"}}}}}
