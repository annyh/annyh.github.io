We agreed that’s tough to tackle without forcing students to choose certain professions. Here’s two proposed courses that would actually benefit anyone, regardless of the profession. </p>\n<h3>How to make money from money</h3>\n<p>The traditional education system prepares people to become workers in corporate America. High income workers are seen as successes, the embodiment of the American dream. The high costs of being a high income worker is conveniently omitted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>high salaries tend to congregate in high cost cities, ie. San Francisco, New York City, Seattle, … </li>\n<li>income taxes penalize the high income earners; since that is the only stream of revenue for most people, that’s a big cut from the paycheck</li>\n<li>high salary jobs in the private sector are vulnerable to layoffs </li>\n<li>if the demand for the job decreases, the income stream may dry up  </li>\n<li>high salary white collar positions often require an education, and the <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education-postsecondary/reports/2019/06/12/470893/addressing-1-5-trillion-federal-student-loan-debt/\">$1.5 trillion of cumulative federal student loan debt</a> can mean decade-long payments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Combine all of the above and you have the <strong>working rich</strong>; people with <strong>high income and low net worth</strong>. Additionally these people are <strong>time poor</strong>, and they fuss over a car or vacation more than learning how to manage money. The average joe never learns how to make money from money once they enter the rat race.</p>\n<p>To target these time-poor people, scams abound. <em>Get rich quick from the stock market! Pick these stocks!</em> <a href=\"https://www.tradeciety.com/24-statistics-why-most-traders-lose-money/\">Most people lose money trading</a>. Others don’t trade; they park their retirment income in the stock market, then panic sell when the market corrects. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrich/2016/02/29/warren-buffett-explains-why-over-time-stocks-go-up/#5cb66baf1393\">The stock market goes up long term</a>, but most people are concerned with the superficials (the company stock went down today by $23!) and not with the bigger picture. </p>\n<h4>Proposed course content:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/stock-market/\">Why the stock market exists</a></li>\n<li>Asset allocation for immediate, medium term needs, including how much to save for a cash cushion</li>\n<li>Economic cycles, ie. what goes up comes down, and vice versa</li>\n<li>How and when to buy stocks with a discount, without time travel </li>\n<li>How to identify quality information from the media</li>\n<li>How to test profit strategies without blowing big amounts of real money</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The goal is for people to not fear the stock market, rather to see it as a congregation of speculators. Ideally the course also teaches students to partake in the market in ways that agree with their needs; this may be a follow up course.</p>\n<h3>How to start, grow, and end a long term relationship</h3>\n<p>Schools don’t want to teach this topic because it is almost purely soft skill, however it has huge payoffs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A couple can share the bill, including utility, groceries, Internet, rent/mortgage</li>\n<li>If one person gets laid off, the other person might cover the costs</li>\n<li>Time savings from not going to bars, pubs, or other places to scout for partners</li>\n<li>Increased perceived social value among peers</li>\n<li>Share memories over the years</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is little structured help for this kind of relationship; instead the schools offer advice on resumes and interviews. I suggest <em>we need as much help, if not more, with personal relationships as with professional ones.</em></p>\n<p>What is the cost of not having this knowledge? Badly executed <a href=\"https://thoughtcatalog.com/jacob-geers/2015/07/6-real-breakups-that-end-with-grisly-murder/\">breakups end in death</a>. Another consequence is the pickup industry targeting <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gyk37y/pickup-artist-study-rachel-oneill-seduction-book\">ordinary men who believe women can be gamed, persuaded, or coerced into sex</a>. If the peddled advice doesn’t work, the industry peddles more courses to <em>make it work</em>, but fails because dating is hard. Among different types of dating, the long term relationship is especially hard because the goal is to <a href=\"https://thestripe.com/why-dating-should-be-messy/\">have a meaningful connection with someone you respect, admire, and the desire to build something great together</a>. It is wiser to see the person as someone with needs, wants, and decisons, and work on the relationship together for maximum health, emotional, and financial benefits. Instead of focusing on the details such as setting up online dating profiles, this course allows learners to see the forest, not just the trees.</p>\n<h4>Proposed course content:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Define what you are looking for in a partner and the type of relationship</li>\n<li>Ways to meet and evaluate candidates </li>\n<li>How to discuss, set, and reinforce boundaries</li>\n<li>When to move on from a relationship</li>\n<li>How to move on from a relationship</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are the two skills that anyone can benefit from, regardless of profession. Taking these two courses would go a long way to educate people on two necessary skills in this fast-changing world.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Two classes that need be taught in schools","date":"July 01, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/two-skills/","previous":{"html":"<p>During the epidemic I picked up reading fiction. Thanks to the racial commentary in the news I decided to read about my race. The relatively thin novels (fewer than 230 pages) reflect the vast diversity of the Asian experience; both protagonists are under thirty, both are drug addicts, and both strive to live a good life with hope, racial descrimination, and bad decisions.</p>\n<h3>Hope</h3>\n<p>I learned about Jade Sharma’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Jade-Sharma/dp/1566894425\">Problems</a> after reading about <a href=\"https://lithub.com/mourning-jade-sharma-her-irreverence-her-audacity/\">her death at age 39</a>. As soon as I started reading her novel <em>Problems</em> I could not stop, the text was addictive. The protagonist is a twenty-something Indian American living in New York City. She battles with addiction to drugs and cigarettes while working at a bookstore, having dropped out of a graduate writing program. I identify with the hope in her; she says <em>I can come clean tomorrow</em>, I say <em>I will get more done tomorrow</em>. By the end of the book she was dumped by her young husband, still hasn’t kicked it the habit, and her new job is not entirely legal.</p>\n<p>Leland Cheuk’s novel, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/No-Good-Very-Bad-Asian/dp/1936196999\">No Good Very Bad Asian</a>, has a male protagonist who is almost as hopeful. He tells his rags to riches story while hoping for his daughter to forgive him for his mistakes. Which mistakes? As a successful asian comic with $10 million in net worth, he cheated on his wife and lost custody of the daughter. He too, like Sharma’s protagonist, turned to drugs throughout his life. Unlike Sharma’s protagonist his career ended on an entertaining note, being featured on an episode of his ex-girlfriend’s reality TV show. Read the book to find more about this entertaining and flawed human. He dishes with the hope that the reader will empathize and forgive him for his mistakes. </p>\n<h3>Race, Gender, and Family Ties</h3>\n<p>Sharma’s protagonist, being female, suspects her older lover is banging a white chick instead. There is the subtext that non-white women are perceived as less attractive than white women, which continues in her new line of work. As for gender, the book is filled with commentary such as <em>age is meaner than death</em>, and <em>whether women disappear when men stop wanting to have sex with them</em>. As for family, she came from a single mother home, and was highly attracted to how tightly knit her husband’s family was. This was before her complaints about the marriage led to a divorce.   </p>\n<p>Cheuk’s male protagonist was typecast into ethnic roles in the entertainment industry, limiting his reach and net worth. I loved the description of the entertainment industry as fine dining: start with a white plate since by default everything is White. Occasionally there is protein; that is Black. Finally if there’s any sauce or drizzle, that’s Asian. The protagonist worked hard and <em>kept showing up</em> as a standup comedian and actor, building up to $10 million net worth. His career is a success, but his family ties are weak. His parents expected him to take over his dad’s grocery business, so as a teenager he ran away to tour with a white comic. He expected the comic to adopt him but the comic didn’t. He fell for the comic’s blonde daughter, who dated him because he <em>wouldn’t hurt her</em>. Years later he broke up his family after cheating on his wife. As for his biological parents they remained bitter even after he bought them a house. These negative family ties contributed to his downfall. </p>\n<h3>Bad decisions leads to better ones</h3>\n<p>Sharma’s protagonist had poor choice of friends, surrounding herself with drug addicts, giving free room to one so he would get drugs for her. Her husband divorced her after hearing one complaint too many about him, directed not to him but to an acquaintance. She made positive changes towards the end of the book by renting out a room to a guy who has his life together; he embodies <em>the new normal</em>, a normal free from drugs. The book ends on hope, where she realizes the waves of sadness <em>are just that, passing waves</em>.</p>\n<p>Cheuk’s protagonist goes through two parallel journeys: his career ends on a high note and his family ends on a hopeful note. Starting his comedy career as an insecure teen, he acquired a drug habit to match his mentor. Both the insecurity and drugs continue in adulthood; they were more consistent than his performance stints. His worst decision was when the blonde ex propositioned a rendezvous, and he took his daughter <em>to the rendezvous</em>. Bad parent? Yes. He still is not clean by the end of the book but time runs out, and he wrote a memorable book to address his daughter, who hopefully will forgive him for not being there.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Both Jade Sharma’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Jade-Sharma/dp/1566894425\">Problems</a> and Leland Cheuk’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/No-Good-Very-Bad-Asian/dp/1936196999\">No Good Very Bad Asian</a> are wonderful works of fiction showcasing the diverse nature of Asian characters. Both protagonists are fully formed and relatable. These works remind us we can work towards a better life, there’s always hope, and as a last resort, we can write an entertainig story about our lives.  </p>","fields":{"slug":"/passion-economy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Asians in fiction, specifically No Good Very Bad Asian, and Problems"}},"next":{"html":"<p>I began paper trading selling options in mid June. By July 1st I’ve made 15% annualized profit. Here is what happened.</p>\n<h3>Goal: profit from short term market volatility from COVID</h3>\n<p>I limited my stock selection to stocks hardest hit by COVID, whose prices are hovering near 52 week lows. I want to own these stocks long term, further narrowing the selection. The two stocks with liquid enough options are Simon Property Property group (SPG) the REIT, and Alaska Airlines (ALK). I’m long term bullish on malls, especially for tourist destinations, and I enjoyed myself so much on Alaska Airlines that I almost didn’t make it off of the plane once. </p>\n<h3>Options strategy</h3>\n<p>For both stocks I’m long-term bullish, short-term bearish. Since I’m predicting the stocks to go sideways or drop slightly, I decided to sell puts. I sold puts with the lowest strike prices that return a 30+% annualized profit. I checked the positions daily and chronicled every trade in Google docs, along with the rationale, for future learning and reference.</p>\n<h3>Key events</h3>\n<p><strong>June 15th, 2020</strong>: I bought naked puts on SPG and ALK for the JUNE weekly, with the strike price of $65 while SPG was around $70, and $30 strike price for ALK with the stock price around $37. I bought weekly because I wanted to see the options expire worthless and fast. Profitability was not a concern here, and no buy back orders were placed since the options were meant to expire.  </p>\n<p><strong>June 19th, 2020</strong>: the SPG puts were in the money and converted to shares. I was ok with that; $65 minus premiums felt low compared to SPG’s historical price. I put a limit loss on it at $62; very tight in hindsight, but the market can turn turn sharply. The ALK put expired and I kept the premium. I purchased July monthlies for both stocks, this time with $55 strike price for SPG.</p>\n<p><strong>June 26th 2020</strong>: both stocks dropped due to a reported increase in COVID cases. SPG tumbled to slightly below $62, triggering the STOP order. Both July puts lost value as the underlying stock prices dropped. </p>\n<p><strong>June 28, 2020</strong> <em>Sunday</em>: I placed the orders to roll the July puts to August, getting more credit upfront and buying time. On Monday the orders were executed, I added the LIMIT orders to buy back those puts at 50% gain.</p>\n<p><strong>July 1, 2020</strong> Limit orders to buy back SPG and ALK were executed. Pocketed 15% profit, since th sell orders were placed at 30% expected profit and were closed at half of that.</p>\n<h3>Lessons learned</h3>\n<p>Focusing on <strong>a few positions</strong> is key; with just two stocks and a few positions to monitor, I only needed to check the portfolio once a day.\n<strong>Position sizing</strong> is also important: I was tempted to go with a bigger position size since that means collecting more premiums up front, but that can lead to large losses if the market turns against the prediction (and it did). I only ordered contracts for how many stocks I would be comfortable owning, which was a dozen for SPG and ten for ALK.</p>\n<p>Overall it was a great experience dipping my feet into options. It felt good making money while the market went sideways, which I didn’t do as a buy and hold investor. I’m now sitting in paper cash and looking at whether to continue with SPG and ALK, or go into other battered stocks.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/one-month-options/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I netted 15% profit in 2 weeks trading options"}}}}}
