Reflecting on the trades over the past year, I noticed when selling puts shined, and when it did not.</p>\n<h2>How I started trading options</h2>\n<p>April 2020 was a great time for options traders: quality companies were on a Covid-induced selloff, and volatility was high so puts were highly-priced. Selling a put is similar to selling insurance; you get paid for potentially buying the stock at the strike price.</p>\n<p>One of my trades was <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPG?p=SPG\">Simon Property Group (SPG)</a> back in May 2020. <a href=\"./invest-15000\">I wrote how I chose SPG here</a>; it was a quality stock I wanted to own. I received a $5 monthly premium at the $60 strike price, to potentially buy shares at $60. Annualized returns for the monthly contract was 84%<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>, much more attractive than the &#x3C;2% in a savings account. I sold puts on SPG multiple times to generate income.</p>\n<p>Almost a year later I <a href=\"./gme-week\">sold puts on GameStop</a> to profit from high volatility. I did not want to own GameStop so the trade was more unnerving.</p>\n<p>While collecting premium is nice, selling puts can also be used to acquire stocks at a discount. </p>\n<h2>Is selling puts the best way to acquire stock?</h2>\n<p>Conventional wisdom says <a href=\"https://www.learningmarkets.com/buying-stocks-at-a-discount-by-selling-put-options/\">selling puts on stocks you want to own</a> is a good way to acquire them. My experience was the opposite; in a bull market, selling puts underperformed both holding the stock and buying calls. I know because I tried all three tactics; as the stock market rebounded in 2020 after the march selloff, getting assigned (ie. buy the stock on options expiry) was a challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Buying the stock</strong> outright uses less money than selling puts, since cash-secured puts use 120% of the stock price. For example, I bought a mutual fund similar to <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QQQ/\">QQQ</a> instead of selling puts on QQQ, and the mutual fund performed +60% in one year. It’s proof that <em>in trading, simple techniques can beat complicated setups</em>.</p>\n<p>Instead of buy-and-hold, for <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/jwn\">Nordstrom (JWN)</a> in October 2020 I <strong>bought a call</strong> expiring in January 2021. I expected the stock to rise above the $13 strike price. It was my first time buying a call so I bought one contract to wait three months. The benefit was clear; for $2.5 premium I controlled 100 shares and used $250 instead of $1100<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>It could have been my most profitable trade: during January 2021 JWN’s price rose to $38 and each contract was worth 100 x ($38 - $13)= $2,600, over 10 times the premium. Too bad I already closed the trade at 100% profit. I wish I bought more contracts and waited more, but hindsight is 20/20.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I started trading options by selling puts. Selling puts is best for generating income during high volatility, however during bull markets it’s best to buy-and-hold or buy calls.</p>\n<p>2020 was a bullish year. I look forward to learn more about options in 2021.</p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> 365 / 30 * 5 / ( 60 * 1.2) = 84%</p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> $11 was Nordstrom’s stock price in October 2020    </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My favorite options strategy","date":"February 13, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/favorite-option-strategy/","previous":{"html":"<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Within four days I made $3800 with GameStop(GME). During the four days, both my brokerage accounts and emotions oscillated like a roller coaster. This was my first time trading a <a href=\"https://marker.medium.com/gamestop-proves-were-in-a-meme-stock-bubble-b3f39163a77f\">meme stock</a>.</p>\n<h2>How I learned about GameStop (GME)</h2>\n<p>During late January GME’s price was erratic due to <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-short-squeeze-is-now-a-retail-rout-51612281395\">short squeeze</a>  and price fluctuations. Its price rose from $20 in December to $350 within a month. After a few brokerages <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-amc-trading-is-now-being-restricted-at-td-ameritrade-11611769804\">limited or banned trading the stock</a> the news coverage increased. I finally looked into why GME was in the news on Monday, February 1st. The stock was still overvalued at $220. Many traders from <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/\">r/WallStreetBets</a> posted their winnings, and I was eager to learn how they made money.</p>\n<h2>Why I jumped in</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/chart/\">GME stock</a> was almost $4 in July 2020 and the company has not improved dramatically to merit a $220 price tag. As the price rose an <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2021/02/03/matt-francis-gamestop-amazon.html\">ex-Amazon joined as the CTO</a>, but the headwinds remained. The stock won’t stay at $220. Volatility can be profitable.</p>\n<h2>How to make money with GME?</h2>\n<p>I went through my checklist with GME:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Is this a long term or short term trade?</strong> Short term and I had no intention of holding the stock.</li>\n<li><strong>How short is the term?</strong> I went with the option expiring in the current week, with plans to close by Friday to avoid watching the price on Saturday.   </li>\n<li><strong>Trade the stock or options?</strong> I didn’t want to hold the stock or short it, so options it is.</li>\n<li><strong>Call or puts?</strong> Calls were exorbitantly priced given the stock’s high price. With puts I have more experience; I sold <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/options-strategy-guide/shortput-cashsecured\">cash-secured puts</a> on other stocks for almost a year. Far out-the-money puts (with a strike price much lower than the stock price) were affordable; they would have been profitable when the stock price plummeted, but I didn’t consider them enough to purchase.</li>\n<li><strong>Buy or sell?</strong> I wanted a high probability bet, collect premium upfront, and benefit from the time decay, so selling it is. I went with a strike price of $50 with less than 10% probability. The premium would be $1.3, which puts maximum profitability at 198%<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. </li>\n<li><strong>How much money to risk?</strong> Since this was a volatile stock, I did not <em>bet the farm</em>, dip into my savings, or borrow money. So I settled for 14 contracts to control 1400 shares.</li>\n<li><strong>What is the exit strategy?</strong> I planned to exit at 50% profitability, ie. buy to close when the option’s price reaches 50% of its selling price.</li>\n<li><strong>What if the market went against the position?</strong> I would take the assignment and sell the stock. If the stock crashed from $220 to $50 in one week, it might be able to recover during the following week.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>A rollickin’ week</h2>\n<p><strong>Monday</strong></p>\n<p>I combed through <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/options/\">r/options</a> to see others’ take on how to make money from GME. This subreddit is more educational and less crazy than r/WallStreetBets. </p>\n<p><em>Feeling: greed</em>. I put in an order to sell the current week’s option for 11 contracts for the strike price of $50 at a $1.3 premium.</p>\n<p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>\n<p>Good news: my orders went through at a $3 premium, twice the price I put in. Bad news: GME plummeted from $220 to $88, and my puts were <a href=\"https://www.mystockoptions.com/content/what-are-underwater-stock-options-why-shouldnt-i-exercise-them\">underwater</a>. I sold another three contracts of the weekly options at an $8 premium. </p>\n<p>I realized if I <em>bought</em> puts instead of selling them I’d make 200+% gains in one day. I looked into buying puts: they were expensive after the stock dropped sharply.</p>\n<p><em>Feeling: fear.</em> If stock plummets to below $50 on Friday, since I sold puts I would buy them at $50. Ideally, I wouldn’t hold the shares. Notice how quickly greed turns to fear when dealing with the stock market.</p>\n<p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p>\n<p>GME’s price rose to over $90. Instead of the 50% profitability, I put in orders to Buy To Close at a $0.6 premium to close out this week’s puts. They did not go through.</p>\n<p><em>Feeling: greed.</em> I was willing to wait until the last trading hour on Friday to collect the maximum premium.</p>\n<p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>\n<p>GME drops to around $53. 11 out of my 14 option contracts were underwater. I waited for the stock to rebound later that day; it didn’t. </p>\n<p>As for buying puts I almost placed an order to buy the $30 strike price; if I did I would have made money by end of the day, oh well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-lifts-buy-restrictions-gamestop-050635340.html\">As Robinhood lifted trading restrictions on GME near the end of day</a> I anticipated the stock price to rise over $50, but who knows what’ll happen.</p>\n<p><em>Feeling: fear.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Friday</strong></p>\n<p>I got up at 7 am PST (early for me) to close GME positions at $1.5 premium or better. As the orders were executed the share price rose from $60’s to $80’s. I glared at the app until all the positions were closed. </p>\n<p>When I looked up puts for a new order, all the quotes came back as 0. The stock was halted; another reason to stay away from GME.</p>\n<p><em>Feeling: relief</em> </p>\n<h2>Reflection</h2>\n<p>Overall annualized gains were 578%<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> during the four days. The stock was volatile and I had fourteen contracts; I could have been assigned 1400 shares, too large of a position. I would feel better selling fewer contracts, and buying more puts.</p>\n<p>As for timing, the returns would be similar if I closed the position two days earlier on Wednesday, had I stuck to the 50% profitability. Exiting earlier would have freed money and curtailed the trepidation.</p>\n<p>I learned one way to increase profitability when trading on volatility is to use <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/032614/which-vertical-option-spread-should-you-use.asp\">vertical spreads</a>: it combines selling and buying puts, and the bought puts will be profitable when the stock price plummets.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>With the GME trade, I got $3800 for four days of trepidation. It was a hasty decision to take advantage of volatility, and it paid off. I also got more excitement than I bargained for; next time I’d target a non-meme stock, or trade fewer contracts. </p>\n<p>I’m happy with the results and look forward to learning more about options.</p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> 198% = 365 / 4* 1.3 / (50 * 1.2))</p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> 578% = 365 / 4 * 3.8 / (50 * 1.2)</p>","fields":{"slug":"/gme-week/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Trading GME: a journey through fear and greed"}},"next":null}}}
