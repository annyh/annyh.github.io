During the four days, both my brokerage accounts and emotions oscillated like a roller coaster. This was my first time trading a <a href=\"https://marker.medium.com/gamestop-proves-were-in-a-meme-stock-bubble-b3f39163a77f\">meme stock</a>.</p>\n<h2>How I learned about GameStop (GME)</h2>\n<p>During late January GME’s price was erratic due to <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-short-squeeze-is-now-a-retail-rout-51612281395\">short squeeze</a>  and price fluctuations. Its price rose from $20 in December to $350 within a month. After a few brokerages <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-amc-trading-is-now-being-restricted-at-td-ameritrade-11611769804\">limited or banned trading the stock</a> the news coverage increased. I finally looked into why GME was in the news on Monday, February 1st. The stock was still overvalued at $220. Many traders from <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/\">r/WallStreetBets</a> posted their winnings, and I was eager to learn how they made money.</p>\n<h2>Why I jumped in</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/chart/\">GME stock</a> was almost $4 in July 2020 and the company has not improved dramatically to merit a $220 price tag. As the price rose an <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2021/02/03/matt-francis-gamestop-amazon.html\">ex-Amazon joined as the CTO</a>, but the headwinds remained. The stock won’t stay at $220. Volatility can be profitable.</p>\n<h2>How to make money with GME?</h2>\n<p>I went through my checklist with GME:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Is this a long term or short term trade?</strong> Short term and I had no intention of holding the stock.</li>\n<li><strong>How short is the term?</strong> I went with the option expiring in the current week, with plans to close by Friday to avoid watching the price on Saturday.   </li>\n<li><strong>Trade the stock or options?</strong> I didn’t want to hold the stock or short it, so options it is.</li>\n<li><strong>Call or puts?</strong> Calls were exorbitantly priced given the stock’s high price. With puts I have more experience; I sold <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/options-strategy-guide/shortput-cashsecured\">cash-secured puts</a> on other stocks for almost a year. Far out-the-money puts (with a strike price much lower than the stock price) were affordable; they would have been profitable when the stock price plummeted, but I didn’t consider them enough to purchase.</li>\n<li><strong>Buy or sell?</strong> I wanted a high probability bet, collect premium upfront, and benefit from the time decay, so selling it is. I went with a strike price of $50 with less than 10% probability. The premium would be $1.3, which puts maximum profitability at 198%<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. </li>\n<li><strong>How much money to risk?</strong> Since this was a volatile stock, I did not <em>bet the farm</em>, dip into my savings, or borrow money. So I settled for 14 contracts to control 1400 shares.</li>\n<li><strong>What is the exit strategy?</strong> I planned to exit at 50% profitability, ie. buy to close when the option’s price reaches 50% of its selling price.</li>\n<li><strong>What if the market went against the position?</strong> I would take the assignment and sell the stock. If the stock crashed from $220 to $50 in one week, it might be able to recover during the following week.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>A rollickin’ week</h2>\n<p><strong>Monday</strong></p>\n<p>I combed through <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/options/\">r/options</a> to see others’ take on how to make money from GME. This subreddit is more educational and less crazy than r/WallStreetBets. </p>\n<p><em>Feeling: greed</em>. I put in an order to sell the current week’s option for 11 contracts for the strike price of $50 at a $1.3 premium.</p>\n<p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>\n<p>Good news: my orders went through at a $3 premium, twice the price I put in. Bad news: GME plummeted from $220 to $88, and my puts were <a href=\"https://www.mystockoptions.com/content/what-are-underwater-stock-options-why-shouldnt-i-exercise-them\">underwater</a>. I sold another three contracts of the weekly options at an $8 premium. </p>\n<p>I realized if I <em>bought</em> puts instead of selling them I’d make 200+% gains in one day. I looked into buying puts: they were expensive after the stock dropped sharply.</p>\n<p><em>Feeling: fear.</em> If stock plummets to below $50 on Friday, since I sold puts I would buy them at $50. Ideally, I wouldn’t hold the shares. Notice how quickly greed turns to fear when dealing with the stock market.</p>\n<p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p>\n<p>GME’s price rose to over $90. Instead of the 50% profitability, I put in orders to Buy To Close at a $0.6 premium to close out this week’s puts. They did not go through.</p>\n<p><em>Feeling: greed.</em> I was willing to wait until the last trading hour on Friday to collect the maximum premium.</p>\n<p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>\n<p>GME drops to around $53. 11 out of my 14 option contracts were underwater. I waited for the stock to rebound later that day; it didn’t. </p>\n<p>As for buying puts I almost placed an order to buy the $30 strike price; if I did I would have made money by end of the day, oh well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-lifts-buy-restrictions-gamestop-050635340.html\">As Robinhood lifted trading restrictions on GME near the end of day</a> I anticipated the stock price to rise over $50, but who knows what’ll happen.</p>\n<p><em>Feeling: fear.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Friday</strong></p>\n<p>I got up at 7 am PST (early for me) to close GME positions at $1.5 premium or better. As the orders were executed the share price rose from $60’s to $80’s. I glared at the app until all the positions were closed. </p>\n<p>When I looked up puts for a new order, all the quotes came back as 0. The stock was halted; another reason to stay away from GME.</p>\n<p><em>Feeling: relief</em> </p>\n<h2>Reflection</h2>\n<p>Overall annualized gains were 578%<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> during the four days. The stock was volatile and I had fourteen contracts; I could have been assigned 1400 shares, too large of a position. I would feel better selling fewer contracts, and buying more puts.</p>\n<p>As for timing, the returns would be similar if I closed the position two days earlier on Wednesday, had I stuck to the 50% profitability. Exiting earlier would have freed money and curtailed the trepidation.</p>\n<p>I learned one way to increase profitability when trading on volatility is to use <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/032614/which-vertical-option-spread-should-you-use.asp\">vertical spreads</a>: it combines selling and buying puts, and the bought puts will be profitable when the stock price plummets.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>With the GME trade, I got $3800 for four days of trepidation. It was a hasty decision to take advantage of volatility, and it paid off. I also got more excitement than I bargained for; next time I’d target a non-meme stock, or trade fewer contracts. </p>\n<p>I’m happy with the results and look forward to learning more about options.</p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> 198% = 365 / 4* 1.3 / (50 * 1.2))</p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> 578% = 365 / 4 * 3.8 / (50 * 1.2)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Trading GME: a journey through fear and greed","date":"February 05, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/gme-week/","previous":{"html":"<p>During the epidemic, I read up on how to start and succeed as a small business owner. I came across Adam Davidson’s book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Economy-Thriving-Twenty-First-Century/dp/0385353529\">the Passion Economy</a>, on a list of best non-fiction books. Even though it was over 300 pages long I devoured it in one evening. Here are 9 takeaways. </p>\n<h3>1. Figure out why you are interested in the Passion Economy</h3>\n<p>Passion Economy is a term that Adam used to describe profitable niche companies that big companies rarely compete with. Examples included OCHO Candy Inc, a candy with organic materials selling across the US, and <a href=\"https://humu.com/\">Humu</a>, a data-centric business founded by ex-Googlers to incentivize employees to stay longer. Both companies occupy a niche. Ie. OCHO competes against the Mars candy company, and Huhu goes deeper than anonymous data and offers “nudges” curated per employee. </p>\n<p>I’m interested in the Passion Economy because I’m a content creator. I’m curious about how the future of content will be delivered and digested, give the ever shorter content lifecycles and the growing demand for quality entertainment. While there are the big content creators ie. the various streaming platforms, I wonder if there’s a way to bring together writers and moviemakers into a company that produces quality content, year-round.</p>\n<h3>2. There are two kinds of geniuses</h3>\n<p>The first kind are the Albert Einsteins: they make great discoveries, and their discoveries are difficult to understand for the average person. </p>\n<p>The second kind are those who make the incomprehensible comprehensible. </p>\n<p>I aspire to achieve the later kind of genius, by creating content to clarify the complex. An example of what I’ve seen is the <strong>Patriot Act</strong>, a Netflix show starring Hasan Minhaj. Each episode is funny, informative, and goes into political topics such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MykMQfmLIro&#x26;ab_channel=NetflixIsAJoke\">Elections</a> and how <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrKxOnNaGHc&#x26;ab_channel=NetflixIsAJoke\">Corononavirus broke America</a>. I strive to be informative and funny, just like Hasan. </p>\n<h3>3. Separate value creation from value capture</h3>\n<p>Nike creates value by creating products with a large premium through celebrity sponsorships. Then it captures the value by sharing the premium via large advertising spend. This is a high cost, high margin example. The product is not the only deliverable; the consumer also desires the association with sports legends such as Serena Williams.</p>\n<h3>4. Pick your customer and pick your competition</h3>\n<p>To pick your customer, talk to 20 potential customers. See what their reaction to your product is. </p>\n<p>To pick your competition find a niche that is poorly served by large companies. For example a garment manufacturer went after workers who needed fire-tolerant clothing, but whose clothes from DuPont were not breathable. When their workers took off the clothes during summer the companies were fined. Another example is a brush company that sold brushes to a nuclear power plant because its requirements were unfulfilled by cheaper brushes.</p>\n<h3>5. Let the price drive the costs</h3>\n<p>In the Passion economy, much of the cost is in the knowledge, creativity, and time to think. Charge a lot, then earn it. The price should feel good to you. Determine the value by having conversations with customers to see where they can most improve. If they refuse the service, you can ask what they went with instead. This also applies to employees; while the salary is the price, you can pinpoint special projects that only you can execute. The key is to avoid being a commodity because commodities compete on price, and price battles are a losing proposition.</p>\n<h3>6. Change value capture constantly, change value creation slowly</h3>\n<p>Going back to the Nike example. Nike creates sportswear, which is the value creation. It has multiple value capture methods, including creating <a href=\"https://www.nike.com/nike-by-you\">custom shoes</a>. </p>\n<h3>7. Revenue matters less than profit</h3>\n<p>It is refreshing to read a book about non-tech companies. Many tech companies follow a revenue growth policy while ignoring the bottom line. This book follows advice from <a href=\"http://www.jasonblumer.com/\">Jason Blumer</a>, an accountant turned consultant who advises companies to charge high and earn it. This means pursuing a more targeted customer base, forsaking the top line for high margins.  </p>\n<h3>8. Add nudges to increase long-term happiness</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory\">Nudges</a> is a behavioral concept: make the desired behavior easier to do than undesirable behavior. For example, automated contributions to retirement accounts led to more people saving for retirement. </p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://humu.com/\">Humu</a>, an HR data-centric business, the software nudges the manager at the time of the scheduling to pick from a list of available people, instead of asking whoever comes to mind. The managers are also nudged to have career conversations, increasing the likelihood of the frontline staff to stay at the fast-food restaurant longer. Each six-month stay contributes to a 1% bump in the bottom line; given most fast-food chains have a profit margin of 6%, a 1% gain is significant.</p>\n<h3>9. Manager as coach</h3>\n<p>The ideal manager is a coach that understands each team member and helps them achieve their goals. This is easier said than done since each manager is a link in a chain with someone else to answer to. Still, it’s a theory that I agree with and something to aspire to.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Overall I enjoyed Adam Davidson’s book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Economy-Thriving-Twenty-First-Century/dp/0385353529\">the Passion Economy</a>. It gave plenty of examples of how to succeed as a profitable niche company in the twenty-first century. The basic framework asks these four questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What are the things I know how to do</li>\n<li>Who would most benefit from these things?</li>\n<li>How much would they benefit? Quantify the benefit in dollars.</li>\n<li>How can I frame what I do so people can see the benefit and agree to price based on value?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I recommend the book to anyone who wants to study small businesses. It is a fast and informative read.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/asian-fiction/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"9 takeaways from the Passion Economy"}},"next":{"html":"<p>My first options trade was selling a put; since then I’ve experimented with other strategies. Reflecting on the trades over the past year, I noticed when selling puts shined, and when it did not.</p>\n<h2>How I started trading options</h2>\n<p>April 2020 was a great time for options traders: quality companies were on a Covid-induced selloff, and volatility was high so puts were highly-priced. Selling a put is similar to selling insurance; you get paid for potentially buying the stock at the strike price.</p>\n<p>One of my trades was <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPG?p=SPG\">Simon Property Group (SPG)</a> back in May 2020. <a href=\"./invest-15000\">I wrote how I chose SPG here</a>; it was a quality stock I wanted to own. I received a $5 monthly premium at the $60 strike price, to potentially buy shares at $60. Annualized returns for the monthly contract was 84%<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>, much more attractive than the &#x3C;2% in a savings account. I sold puts on SPG multiple times to generate income.</p>\n<p>Almost a year later I <a href=\"./gme-week\">sold puts on GameStop</a> to profit from high volatility. I did not want to own GameStop so the trade was more unnerving.</p>\n<p>While collecting premium is nice, selling puts can also be used to acquire stocks at a discount. </p>\n<h2>Is selling puts the best way to acquire stock?</h2>\n<p>Conventional wisdom says <a href=\"https://www.learningmarkets.com/buying-stocks-at-a-discount-by-selling-put-options/\">selling puts on stocks you want to own</a> is a good way to acquire them. My experience was the opposite; in a bull market, selling puts underperformed both holding the stock and buying calls. I know because I tried all three tactics; as the stock market rebounded in 2020 after the march selloff, getting assigned (ie. buy the stock on options expiry) was a challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Buying the stock</strong> outright uses less money than selling puts, since cash-secured puts use 120% of the stock price. For example, I bought a mutual fund similar to <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QQQ/\">QQQ</a> instead of selling puts on QQQ, and the mutual fund performed +60% in one year. It’s proof that <em>in trading, simple techniques can beat complicated setups</em>.</p>\n<p>Instead of buy-and-hold, for <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/jwn\">Nordstrom (JWN)</a> in October 2020 I <strong>bought a call</strong> expiring in January 2021. I expected the stock to rise above the $13 strike price. It was my first time buying a call so I bought one contract to wait three months. The benefit was clear; for $2.5 premium I controlled 100 shares and used $250 instead of $1100<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>It could have been my most profitable trade: during January 2021 JWN’s price rose to $38 and each contract was worth 100 x ($38 - $13)= $2,600, over 10 times the premium. Too bad I already closed the trade at 100% profit. I wish I bought more contracts and waited more, but hindsight is 20/20.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I started trading options by selling puts. Selling puts is best for generating income during high volatility, however during bull markets it’s best to buy-and-hold or buy calls.</p>\n<p>2020 was a bullish year. I look forward to learn more about options in 2021.</p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> 365 / 30 * 5 / ( 60 * 1.2) = 84%</p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> $11 was Nordstrom’s stock price in October 2020    </p>","fields":{"slug":"/favorite-option-strategy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My favorite options strategy"}}}}}
