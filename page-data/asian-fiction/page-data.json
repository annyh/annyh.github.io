I came across Adam Davidson’s book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Economy-Thriving-Twenty-First-Century/dp/0385353529\">the Passion Economy</a>, on a list of best non-fiction books. Even though it was over 300 pages long I devoured it in one evening. Here are 9 takeaways. </p>\n<h3>1. Figure out why you are interested in the Passion Economy</h3>\n<p>Passion Economy is a term that Adam used to describe profitable niche companies that big companies rarely compete with. Examples included OCHO Candy Inc, a candy with organic materials selling across the US, and <a href=\"https://humu.com/\">Humu</a>, a data-centric business founded by ex-Googlers to incentivize employees to stay longer. Both companies occupy a niche. Ie. OCHO competes against the Mars candy company, and Huhu goes deeper than anonymous data and offers “nudges” curated per employee. </p>\n<p>I’m interested in the Passion Economy because I’m a content creator. I’m curious about how the future of content will be delivered and digested, give the ever shorter content lifecycles and the growing demand for quality entertainment. While there are the big content creators ie. the various streaming platforms, I wonder if there’s a way to bring together writers and moviemakers into a company that produces quality content, year-round.</p>\n<h3>2. There are two kinds of geniuses</h3>\n<p>The first kind are the Albert Einsteins: they make great discoveries, and their discoveries are difficult to understand for the average person. </p>\n<p>The second kind are those who make the incomprehensible comprehensible. </p>\n<p>I aspire to achieve the later kind of genius, by creating content to clarify the complex. An example of what I’ve seen is the <strong>Patriot Act</strong>, a Netflix show starring Hasan Minhaj. Each episode is funny, informative, and goes into political topics such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MykMQfmLIro&#x26;ab_channel=NetflixIsAJoke\">Elections</a> and how <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrKxOnNaGHc&#x26;ab_channel=NetflixIsAJoke\">Corononavirus broke America</a>. I strive to be informative and funny, just like Hasan. </p>\n<h3>3. Separate value creation from value capture</h3>\n<p>Nike creates value by creating products with a large premium through celebrity sponsorships. Then it captures the value by sharing the premium via large advertising spend. This is a high cost, high margin example. The product is not the only deliverable; the consumer also desires the association with sports legends such as Serena Williams.</p>\n<h3>4. Pick your customer and pick your competition</h3>\n<p>To pick your customer, talk to 20 potential customers. See what their reaction to your product is. </p>\n<p>To pick your competition find a niche that is poorly served by large companies. For example a garment manufacturer went after workers who needed fire-tolerant clothing, but whose clothes from DuPont were not breathable. When their workers took off the clothes during summer the companies were fined. Another example is a brush company that sold brushes to a nuclear power plant because its requirements were unfulfilled by cheaper brushes.</p>\n<h3>5. Let the price drive the costs</h3>\n<p>In the Passion economy, much of the cost is in the knowledge, creativity, and time to think. Charge a lot, then earn it. The price should feel good to you. Determine the value by having conversations with customers to see where they can most improve. If they refuse the service, you can ask what they went with instead. This also applies to employees; while the salary is the price, you can pinpoint special projects that only you can execute. The key is to avoid being a commodity because commodities compete on price, and price battles are a losing proposition.</p>\n<h3>6. Change value capture constantly, change value creation slowly</h3>\n<p>Going back to the Nike example. Nike creates sportswear, which is the value creation. It has multiple value capture methods, including creating <a href=\"https://www.nike.com/nike-by-you\">custom shoes</a>. </p>\n<h3>7. Revenue matters less than profit</h3>\n<p>It is refreshing to read a book about non-tech companies. Many tech companies follow a revenue growth policy while ignoring the bottom line. This book follows advice from <a href=\"http://www.jasonblumer.com/\">Jason Blumer</a>, an accountant turned consultant who advises companies to charge high and earn it. This means pursuing a more targeted customer base, forsaking the top line for high margins.  </p>\n<h3>8. Add nudges to increase long-term happiness</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory\">Nudges</a> is a behavioral concept: make the desired behavior easier to do than undesirable behavior. For example, automated contributions to retirement accounts led to more people saving for retirement. </p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://humu.com/\">Humu</a>, an HR data-centric business, the software nudges the manager at the time of the scheduling to pick from a list of available people, instead of asking whoever comes to mind. The managers are also nudged to have career conversations, increasing the likelihood of the frontline staff to stay at the fast-food restaurant longer. Each six-month stay contributes to a 1% bump in the bottom line; given most fast-food chains have a profit margin of 6%, a 1% gain is significant.</p>\n<h3>9. Manager as coach</h3>\n<p>The ideal manager is a coach that understands each team member and helps them achieve their goals. This is easier said than done since each manager is a link in a chain with someone else to answer to. Still, it’s a theory that I agree with and something to aspire to.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Overall I enjoyed Adam Davidson’s book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Economy-Thriving-Twenty-First-Century/dp/0385353529\">the Passion Economy</a>. It gave plenty of examples of how to succeed as a profitable niche company in the twenty-first century. The basic framework asks these four questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What are the things I know how to do</li>\n<li>Who would most benefit from these things?</li>\n<li>How much would they benefit? Quantify the benefit in dollars.</li>\n<li>How can I frame what I do so people can see the benefit and agree to price based on value?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I recommend the book to anyone who wants to study small businesses. It is a fast and informative read.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"9 takeaways from the Passion Economy","date":"January 16, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/asian-fiction/","previous":{"html":"<p>As a millenial who buys from the big resellers ie. eBay, Thredup, Poshmark, physical thrift stores, and enjoys the occasional mall experience. I’ve seen the retail landscape shifting from malls to online, from new to second-hand. Here’s how the retail experience can survive the global covid epidemic and compete with Amazon.</p>\n<h3>The middle market need to partner with the second-hand market</h3>\n<p>Luxury will always be there for people who want the latest flashiest things. Big discount stores like Ross will supply necessities for instant gratification. The second-hand market including online resellers and physical consignment stores will eat into the discretionary middle market; why buy something mass produced, when you can get a unique find at a similar price instead? If the middle market ie. stores like Macy’s and Nordstrom want to keep up, they need to include resellers into their midst. Malls can also benefit from a storefront with second-hand stores ie. theRealReal: the fast-changing nature of reseller’s goods can increase traffic. </p>\n<h3>End of fast fashion???</h3>\n<p>As a value shopper I don’t see the value proposition of fast fashion. The goods are often low quality, the style does not last beyond a season, and it is horrible for the environment. Perhaps some find the price point attractive, but paying a bit more is worth it for a higher quality, more durable good that <em>can be resold</em>.</p>\n<h3>Better fit for clothing or shoes means more $$$</h3>\n<p>High-end stores will measure a potential customer and provide recommendations based on the measurements; storing measurements is easy to do, yet many stores, both online and physical, don’t store them, even though they have an account on the customer. The better the fit, the more the customer will pay. Stores are leaving money on the table because what they sell don’t fit. Physical stores can go even further and provide tailoring service to increase value.</p>\n<h3>Limitations of the online experience</h3>\n<p>Customer service for online storefronts are limited; have a problem with the order? It is chat or email only, which might resolve the issue but provides no opportunity for upsell. Shipping delays means instant gratification becomes delayed, slowing down the positive feedback loop. Shipping is bad for the environment, and the increased costs mean online shopping cost more than thrifting locally. High end customers are willing to pay for a better online experience, such as those who go to Equinox and purchase a Peleton; I’m fascinated by their fervent community who shell out $200+/month for a gym membership, and $2000+ for a bike, with monthly payments for content.</p>\n<h3>Why I’m bullish on physycal storefront</h3>\n<p>Can you imagine Apple selling the $2000 iPhones without a wonderful physical presence? I can’t either. The physical storefront used to be a prerequisite for great service, since positive interactions with the employees can lead to repeat sales and upsell. While online experiences have been catching up (such as Peleton customers), the high-end stores will continue to have a physical presence. Many customers will pay more for a proper fit, and the shopping experience facilitated by a real person.</p>\n<h3>How malls can thrive with locals</h3>\n<p>Similar to hotel chains that offer loyalty programs, the malls can provide a reward program that encourages shopping, exercise, tailoring, and more services bundled together. The more you spend the more you save. The mall can also be a place for people to sell their goods via pop up stores or partnerships with resellers; the fast turnaround of goods and stores means there are more to see per visit.</p>\n<p>The retail landscape seems to change every day, accelerated by the global epidemic. What doesn’t change is good customer service to provide value, such as knowing the customer’s measurements and tailoring for fit. The online experience contiues to evolve upwards into the high end market. The middle market is changing with integrations of indie designers and resellers; it is a tough place to be in, squeezed by the resellers and the low low price of fast fashion. </p>\n<p>Retail is a fast changing space with lots going on. Whatever happens, it won’t be boring.  </p>","fields":{"slug":"/future-retail/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The future of retail, according to a millenial"}},"next":{"html":"<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Within four days I made $3800 with GameStop(GME). During the four days, both my brokerage accounts and emotions oscillated like a roller coaster. This was my first time trading a <a href=\"https://marker.medium.com/gamestop-proves-were-in-a-meme-stock-bubble-b3f39163a77f\">meme stock</a>.</p>\n<h2>How I learned about GameStop (GME)</h2>\n<p>During late January GME’s price was erratic due to <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-short-squeeze-is-now-a-retail-rout-51612281395\">short squeeze</a>  and price fluctuations. Its price rose from $20 in December to $350 within a month. After a few brokerages <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-amc-trading-is-now-being-restricted-at-td-ameritrade-11611769804\">limited or banned trading the stock</a> the news coverage increased. I finally looked into why GME was in the news on Monday, February 1st. The stock was still overvalued at $220. Many traders from <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/\">r/WallStreetBets</a> posted their winnings, and I was eager to learn how they made money.</p>\n<h2>Why I jumped in</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/chart/\">GME stock</a> was almost $4 in July 2020 and the company has not improved dramatically to merit a $220 price tag. As the price rose an <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2021/02/03/matt-francis-gamestop-amazon.html\">ex-Amazon joined as the CTO</a>, but the headwinds remained. The stock won’t stay at $220. Volatility can be profitable.</p>\n<h2>How to make money with GME?</h2>\n<p>I went through my checklist with GME:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Is this a long term or short term trade?</strong> Short term and I had no intention of holding the stock.</li>\n<li><strong>How short is the term?</strong> I went with the option expiring in the current week, with plans to close by Friday to avoid watching the price on Saturday.   </li>\n<li><strong>Trade the stock or options?</strong> I didn’t want to hold the stock or short it, so options it is.</li>\n<li><strong>Call or puts?</strong> Calls were exorbitantly priced given the stock’s high price. With puts I have more experience; I sold <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/options-strategy-guide/shortput-cashsecured\">cash-secured puts</a> on other stocks for almost a year. Far out-the-money puts (with a strike price much lower than the stock price) were affordable; they would have been profitable when the stock price plummeted, but I didn’t consider them enough to purchase.</li>\n<li><strong>Buy or sell?</strong> I wanted a high probability bet, collect premium upfront, and benefit from the time decay, so selling it is. I went with a strike price of $50 with less than 10% probability. The premium would be $1.3, which puts maximum profitability at 198%<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. </li>\n<li><strong>How much money to risk?</strong> Since this was a volatile stock, I did not <em>bet the farm</em>, dip into my savings, or borrow money. So I settled for 14 contracts to control 1400 shares.</li>\n<li><strong>What is the exit strategy?</strong> I planned to exit at 50% profitability, ie. buy to close when the option’s price reaches 50% of its selling price.</li>\n<li><strong>What if the market went against the position?</strong> I would take the assignment and sell the stock. If the stock crashed from $220 to $50 in one week, it might be able to recover during the following week.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>A rollickin’ week</h2>\n<p><strong>Monday</strong></p>\n<p>I combed through <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/options/\">r/options</a> to see others’ take on how to make money from GME. This subreddit is more educational and less crazy than r/WallStreetBets. </p>\n<p><em>Feeling: greed</em>. I put in an order to sell the current week’s option for 11 contracts for the strike price of $50 at a $1.3 premium.</p>\n<p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>\n<p>Good news: my orders went through at a $3 premium, twice the price I put in. Bad news: GME plummeted from $220 to $88, and my puts were <a href=\"https://www.mystockoptions.com/content/what-are-underwater-stock-options-why-shouldnt-i-exercise-them\">underwater</a>. I sold another three contracts of the weekly options at an $8 premium. </p>\n<p>I realized if I <em>bought</em> puts instead of selling them I’d make 200+% gains in one day. I looked into buying puts: they were expensive after the stock dropped sharply.</p>\n<p><em>Feeling: fear.</em> If stock plummets to below $50 on Friday, since I sold puts I would buy them at $50. Ideally, I wouldn’t hold the shares. Notice how quickly greed turns to fear when dealing with the stock market.</p>\n<p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p>\n<p>GME’s price rose to over $90. Instead of the 50% profitability, I put in orders to Buy To Close at a $0.6 premium to close out this week’s puts. They did not go through.</p>\n<p><em>Feeling: greed.</em> I was willing to wait until the last trading hour on Friday to collect the maximum premium.</p>\n<p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>\n<p>GME drops to around $53. 11 out of my 14 option contracts were underwater. I waited for the stock to rebound later that day; it didn’t. </p>\n<p>As for buying puts I almost placed an order to buy the $30 strike price; if I did I would have made money by end of the day, oh well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-lifts-buy-restrictions-gamestop-050635340.html\">As Robinhood lifted trading restrictions on GME near the end of day</a> I anticipated the stock price to rise over $50, but who knows what’ll happen.</p>\n<p><em>Feeling: fear.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Friday</strong></p>\n<p>I got up at 7 am PST (early for me) to close GME positions at $1.5 premium or better. As the orders were executed the share price rose from $60’s to $80’s. I glared at the app until all the positions were closed. </p>\n<p>When I looked up puts for a new order, all the quotes came back as 0. The stock was halted; another reason to stay away from GME.</p>\n<p><em>Feeling: relief</em> </p>\n<h2>Reflection</h2>\n<p>Overall annualized gains were 578%<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> during the four days. The stock was volatile and I had fourteen contracts; I could have been assigned 1400 shares, too large of a position. I would feel better selling fewer contracts, and buying more puts.</p>\n<p>As for timing, the returns would be similar if I closed the position two days earlier on Wednesday, had I stuck to the 50% profitability. Exiting earlier would have freed money and curtailed the trepidation.</p>\n<p>I learned one way to increase profitability when trading on volatility is to use <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/032614/which-vertical-option-spread-should-you-use.asp\">vertical spreads</a>: it combines selling and buying puts, and the bought puts will be profitable when the stock price plummets.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>With the GME trade, I got $3800 for four days of trepidation. It was a hasty decision to take advantage of volatility, and it paid off. I also got more excitement than I bargained for; next time I’d target a non-meme stock, or trade fewer contracts. </p>\n<p>I’m happy with the results and look forward to learning more about options.</p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> 198% = 365 / 4* 1.3 / (50 * 1.2))</p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> 578% = 365 / 4 * 3.8 / (50 * 1.2)</p>","fields":{"slug":"/gme-week/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Trading GME: a journey through fear and greed"}}}}}
