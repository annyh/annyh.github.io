With a median rent of $3280, the area is so expensive that some <a href=\"https://www.zumper.com/blog/san-francisco-bay-area-metro-report/\">Google employees live in trailers</a>. Here are real stories I’ve heard from coworkers, friends, and acquaintances. This list is ranked from the funkiest to the most reasonable.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sleep on a futon</strong> for $800: a coworker of mine rented out his futon in the middle of the living room for $800/month. There was no privacy but it was a steal at 25% of the median rent</li>\n<li><strong>Sleep in a car</strong> for &#x3C; $1000/month: a friend from college lives in a car. He pays for a monthly parking permit and has factored in the cost of break-ins</li>\n<li>Live <strong>in a hostel</strong> for $1500: During my internship, I lived in a private room in a hostel that offered long term living arrangements. You get a private room but everything else is shared, including the bathroom and the kitchen</li>\n<li>Live <strong>in a boat</strong>: there’s the low budget boat, which an acquaintance paid &#x3C; $20,000 for but maintains every weekend, and then there’s a higher-end boat which two Directors at Salesforce live in. The pair plan to sail into the sunset once they’ve made a certain sum from Corporate America. I love this real-life romantic version of the American Dream :)</li>\n<li>Live with significant other in <strong>subsidized housing</strong> for $800: a coworker’s girlfriend works as an equestrian; they live in subsidized housing for $800, what a deal! Another person works at Google and lives with their boyfriend who is studying for his Ph.D. at Stanford</li>\n<li>Live in a house with <strong>5 other roommates</strong>: this is common in houses and high end apartments/condos. A couple may share a room while the rest of the twenty-something crew split the rest. The big limiting factor is the number of bathrooms; I’ve heard horror stories of 6 people living in a house with 1 bathroom</li>\n<li>Live <strong>in the living room</strong>: I know coworkers who live in the main room with a screen separating their space from the rest. When I brought up the prospect of living in one myself, a coworker asked: “What if you bringing someone back to the apartment?” I thought about it and didn’t pursue it</li>\n<li>Live in a <strong>300 square foot apartment</strong>: smaller spaces cost less and 300 sq ft is tiny; it barely fits a bed, a nightstand, and a bookcase. A coworker mentioned it forced her to be minimal since she cannot accumulate unwanted stuff. Space is a good forcing function; perhaps that’s why she arrived at the office early and left late</li>\n<li><strong>Move out of California</strong>: given the current epidemic many companies allow workers to work remotely, people move out of the expensive California state. Someone from Toastmasters moved to Oregon; they don’t have sales tax there. I too want to move but my significant other works in the autonomous vehicles industry, which is less remote-friendly</li>\n<li>Live <strong>with parents</strong>: some people get free rent, yet the only coworker who lived with her parents in SF moved out as soon as she got a full-time job. Perhaps the autonomy was worth the rent</li>\n</ol>\n<p>San Franscisco is a strange city where six-figure jobs are common but affordable housing is scarce. Getting a good deal on housing can feel like winning a lottery. Rent remains a significant chunk of most people’s after-tax income. This is food for thought if you ever considered moving into the San Francisco area.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"10 rent hacks in San Francisco from coworkers and friends","date":"July 12, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/rent-hacks/","previous":{"html":"<p>America’s birthday was a sunny day in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>Boyfriend and I came out of our apartment by the bay, our empty stomachs grumbling. The noontime sun bared down at us. We inched towards the Ferry building. </p>\n<p>At the building we got Japanese food: miso soup and curry beef. Yes we ate Asian food on America’s birthday; the city’s culinary options abound. On this day people crowded along the water. We ate on the benches with the dishes on our laps, our heads bent like monks in prayer.</p>\n<p>We headed towards Pier 39 along the Embarcadero street. A dozen nude male cyclists stood around the corner, sunbathing in helmets, shoes, and sunscreen. They smiled and basked in their sunlit glory. I ogled through my sunglasses, happy with the happenstance.</p>\n<p>Along the Embarcadero Harley Davidsons roared; black, orange, and green ones flew by. Their riders sat low; their hair floated like Beyonce’s.</p>\n<p>At Pier 39 the sea lions were missing. Boyfriend googled their whereabouts; during July they were away breeding. I miss their loud and smelly presence and yearn for their return.</p>\n<p>Throughout the afternoon we heard fireworks, and the drama intensified when the evening came. The fireworks streaked the sky, splattering yellow, green, and red on the dark canvas. We enjoyed the sights. Our furry friends lost the control over their bowels.</p>\n<p>T’was a glorious day in the city by the bay. </p>\n<p>Happy birthday America.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/july-fourth/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"July 4th in San Francisco"}},"next":{"html":"<p>This weekend I finally tackled the issue of how to invest a $15000 USD in a tax-deferred account. Tax-deferred means the gains are tax-free until withdrawal. The account comes with these constraints:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I cannot trade options in it; this is a temporary constraint</li>\n<li>I don’t want to replicate positions from other accounts, which are heavy with tech stocks, the Nasdaq index, and an airline stock</li>\n<li>I’m ok monitoring the account weekly, then monthly after establishing a position</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given the above, here are some ideas and thoughts on each:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Trade <strong>tech stocks</strong> since they are volatile and this is a tax-deferred account, but I’m already heavy in tech and want diversification</li>\n<li>Trade <strong>airline stocks</strong> since they are volatile and this is a tax-deferred account, but I already have a position with an airline and want diversification</li>\n<li>Buy and hold <strong>S&#x26;P 500/Russell 2000/Nasdaq 100</strong>, but I already have large positions with index funds</li>\n<li><strong>Buy bonds</strong>, but the interest rates are at all-time lows. The return is simply not there, though better than sitting in cash</li>\n<li><strong>Sit in cash</strong>; not the best option since the brokerage pays less than 1% interest; there are better returns </li>\n<li><strong>Buy undervalued S&#x26;P 500 dividend stocks</strong>. This is what I did with <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HD/\">Home Depot</a> and <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL\">Apple</a>, back in 2017 when they were on sale from a potential trade war between the US and China. No trade war happened yet and the stocks have doubled in price</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’m ok with buying stocks since I have a long time horizon and a high-risk tolerance. While the idea of buying undervalued is good, executing the idea is challenging. Let’s tackle it one question at a time.</p>\n<p><strong>Which undervalued stock to buy?</strong></p>\n<p>Looking at S&#x26;P 500 stocks that are near their 52-week lows, the mall REIT sector has barely recovered. Specifically, SPG, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPG/\">Simon Property Group</a>, the largest real estate company in the US, is trading at 9.9x PE. It owns roughly 200 malls across the country, many in tourism spots. I’m bullish on malls getting back on their feet especially in tourism hotspots, and SPG pays a quarterly dividend with an impressive yield of 8% while we wait. Its annual revenues have increased in the <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SPG/simon-property/revenue\">single digits until the epidemic struck</a>. Its net profit margin as of March 31, 2020, is a healthy 35.2%.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes the stock risky?</strong></p>\n<p>A worsening global epidemic will lead to a delay in mall reopening. Even if the malls reopen, would sales per square foot bounce back to February 2020 levels? How would traditionally brick and mortar stores compete after the epidemic forced shoppers to buy online? Additionally, SPG is in the talks to buy <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/30/heres-why-the-biggest-us-mall-owner-might-want-to-buy-jc-penney.html\">JC Penny</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/06/simon-property-group-part-of-company-bidding-for-a.aspx\">Lucky Brand</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/investing/brooks-brothers-bankruptcy-buyout-offers-simon-property\">Brooks Brothers</a>. It might overpay for one or all three. It is also suing its tenant Gap for <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/gap-stock-simon-property-rent-covid-19-malls-51591277317\">$69.5 million in rent and other charges</a>. Its net income has also decreased in 2019 by 13.89% before the epidemic worsened the drop to 15.95%. </p>\n<p><strong>What is the entry price, and how much to buy?</strong></p>\n<p>Support is $55 and stock price is $65.  I will use a limit order of $60 and use half of the account and buy a multiple of 100. Will check back in another week to see whether it has been executed. If it has not I will either wait or purchase another stock.</p>\n<p><strong>How long to hold it for and what is the planned exit point?</strong></p>\n<p>Since this stock pays dividends quarterly with an annual distribution of $5.2 which is an annual yield of 8.1%, as long as its fundamentals are sound and there are no more ideas for the money, I’ll keep the position with a stop loss of 10%. </p>\n<p>Though if SPG pops back near 52-week highs at 2.5x of its current price I might consider selling it. Hopefully, we will be out of the epidemic then.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/invest-15000/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to invest $15,000 USD in a tax deferred account"}}}}}
