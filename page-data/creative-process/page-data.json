As someone who tried to create graphic novels twice, I knew intimately how challenging that was, so I was curious how she was able to pull off the workload while working as a faculty at a university.</p>\n<p>I tried out her tried-and-true <a href=\"https://jessicaabel.lpages.co/creative-engine-masterclass/\">Creative Engine Masterclass</a> to create more comics, and the process worked! The most powerful part of her one-hour class is when she mentioned how artists <strong>gain confidence by iterating: the more iterations through the 4 phases, the more reflection, and the better the Engine works.</strong> </p>\n<p>It makes sense: <em>the best defense against doubt is reminding it you’ve created art recently, and you can do it again.</em></p>\n<p>Abel stresses there are four phases in the Creative Engine, and to not skip any phase. By taking these tips and focusing on iterating, I went from drawing 4 comics in 1 day and burning out, to drawing 8 comics 1 day, 4 the next day, and 8 comics again on the third day. In three days I’ve iterated through the phases five times and <em>created half as many comics as last year!</em></p>\n<p>By following her framework I can sustainably average 2 comics/day, including breaks. This means almost 720 comics a year, a HUGE confidence boost. <em>I’ll have enough comics to fill a few books!</em></p>\n<h2>Abel’s 4 phases applied to my comic-creation process:</h2>\n<h3>Collect</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Journal comic ideas</li>\n<li>Type up the promising ones</li>\n<li>Edit the typed list: Add notes about layout ie. 3 rows or 3 columns, 4 panels, …</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Decide</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Review the list of bolded items, edit any layouts/visual cues</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Act</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Find pictures to base drawings off of. Usually use Google to find reference drawings</li>\n<li>Draw/reuse a drawing in a sketchbook with a pencil and pen. I tried drawing digitally; so far it’s faster to draw on paper and make minor edits with a mouse</li>\n<li>Scan the drawings and edit text and layout in Photoshop</li>\n<li>Backup to the cloud</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Reflect</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Journal what went well and what could be improved</li>\n<li>Post on my website and social media (ie. Reddit). This is done weekly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Wins</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>I learned the ideal batch size is 4: I can produce 4 comics at a time without burning out, and finish the iteration (from <strong>Decide</strong> to <strong>Reflect</strong>) within 2 hours</li>\n<li>Since the focus is on faster iterations, I simplified my drawing style and decreased the time to find reference photos. Yay!</li>\n<li>Drawing twice a day satisfies my urge to draw. Each drawing session lasts around 45 minutes to 1 hour</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What slows me down</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Running out of ideas during the <strong>Decide</strong> phase, then going back to the collect phase to generate more comic ideas. Some ideas are tossed out because of an unclear punchline, or unclear visual representation</li>\n<li>Adding more drawings after the initial scan. It adds another draw-scan-edit cycle</li>\n<li>Taking long breaks: When a break is 20+ minutes long it’s challenging to get back into the flow</li>\n<li>Checking email/social media during an iteration</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What works</h2>\n<p><strong>The #1 determinant of how many comics I produce is a quality idea list</strong>. Ideally, it has 2+ batches of ready-to-go ideas before I go into the <strong>Decision</strong> phase. If the list is shorter I fear running out of ideas and feel less confident.</p>\n<p>I prefer to work on fresh ideas ie. ideas that are at most one week old. Perhaps I second-guess older ideas.</p>\n<p>For posting to get feedback, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/\">r/writing</a> is very responsive to comics about questions. The subreddit is also underserved by comics since most posts are text. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/\">r/programmerhumor</a> has a larger and opinionated audience.</p>\n<p>Posting on Mondays gets the most traffic, but posting multiple times a week is better than not posting for months because of feedback.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I’m a more confident comics artist, after adapting Jessica Abel’s 4 phase Creative Engine to my comic creation process. It feels good to have a list of new comics to post on social media and blog. My comics <a href=\"https://www.annyhe.com/\">are here</a>.</p>\n<p>My next steps are to create more comic ideas and to go through another 5 iterations. I’ll write up the findings in another post.</p>\n<p>Here is Jessica Abel’s super valuable one-hour <a href=\"https://jessicaabel.lpages.co/creative-engine-masterclass/\">Masterclass on the Creative Engine</a>, and <a href=\"https://jessicaabel.com/blog/\">her blog</a> details more ways to increase the creative output.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to gain artistic confidence","date":"May 10, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/creative-process/","previous":{"html":"<p>I’ve invested in the stock market for 7 years and picked stocks for the last 5. I’ve also traded stock options. For each stock I had a entry point, and exit point, and plans for when the trade went south. I wrote this to remind myself the of the truths of stock-picking, and what makes it fun and dangerous.</p>\n<h2>The ugly truths of stock-picking:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Having a job with stock compensation is a surer way to wealth than trading full time</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I work in tech and pick stocks to diversify away from tech. In addition to providing an income the job provides a 401(k) which allow gains to grow tax-free. Working also limits overtrading, which hurts returns.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Investing and trading is not entertainment</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Only on reddit do writers spew: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lsq77k/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_5/\">“diamond handed apes riding whales screaming war cries in their final push before entering the gates of Valhalla”</a>. While reddit is entertaining, blindly following someone’s tips is a sure way to lose money. Reading reddit is a fun way to get trade ideas, and after research most ideas don’t check out.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>It’s easier to grow and/or destroy smaller accounts</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Articles titled <a href=\"https://financialpost.com/investing/robinhood-investors-top-picks-blowing-away-hedge-funds-market\">“Robinhood investors’ top picks are blowing away hedge funds”</a> make the ordinary sound extraordinary. <a href=\"https://www.brokerage-review.com/investing-firm/assets-under-management/robinhood-aum.aspx\">The average account size in Robinhood is only $1,500</a>, while <a href=\"https://thehedgefundjournal.com/what-lies-beneath/\">a medium sized hedge fund manages billions</a>. It’s easy to double a molehill but not a mountain. The inverse is also true; it’s easy to destroy a molehill, but not a mountain.</p>\n<h2>Fun highlights I’ve experienced in stock-picking:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy and hold can double your money</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I bought Disney(<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DIS/\">DIS</a>), Apple(<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/\">AAPL</a>), and Home Depot(<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HD\">HD</a>) back in 2019, when the threat of Chinese tariffs and the popularity of Netflix rattled these stocks. Now in 2021 Apple almost quadrupled while both Disney and Home Depot doubled: thanks to COVID these companies grew bigger. This is an example of how <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/letyourprofitrun.asp.\">“let your profits run”</a> can yield impressive returns.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Intra-day trading can double your money</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At the tail end of the GameStop(<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME\">GME</a>) craze, when the stock dropped from $80 to $60 in February 2021, a put for $30 strike price expiring that week grew from $2 to $3 in one day. Buying and selling that would have netted 50% return in less than 8 hours. </p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The underlying stock matters</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I have short-term positions on GameStop to take adantage of volatility, but not on HD or Apple or Disney. Each stock is different and requires following.</p>\n<h2>How to lose money via stock-picking</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Selling options and overtrading </li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://ragingbull.com/options-profit-planner/how-to-guarantee-income-like-the-casinos-do/\">Option education courses say selling options is like operating a casino</a>; you make a little money on each transaction, so to make more money, make more transactions. I disagree; the only casino in the investing/trading game are the brokerage houses and the clearing houses; they make money on volume while the retail traders lose money from locking in losses. </p>\n<p>There is also the opportunity cost: I’ve lost out on returns by <a href=\"/favorite-option-strategy/\">selling cash-covered puts</a> during the bull market of April and May 2020, and also by selling covered calls on Salesforce(<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRM\">CRM</a>) and Nvidia(<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA\">NVDA</a>), when their prices peaked.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Following someone’s stock tips blindly</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When a course/chart/person promises to predict the future, run. No one knows the future. The experienced investors have a plan of what to do when a trade goes south, and when to take the winnings off of the table, but they know about the future as much as a beginner does.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Too many stocks</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/now/charlie-munger-on-value-investing-and-the-crisis-in-wealth-management-114327424.html\">Charlie Munger, Warren Buffe’ts business partner, said: “It’s ‘absolute insanity’ to think owning 100 stocks instead of five makes you a better investor”</a>. Doing due diligence is costly. Filtering out trade ideas takes time, and each position requires baby-sitting, especially for short-term positions for volatility play. Volatility is like fire; it can increase returns, but it can also burn down the portfolio.</p>\n<h2>Given the bad news, how to be a good investor?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Avoid overtrading</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There’s a research and monitoring cost per trade, which makes stock-picking expensive. Long-term holds require less monitoring but when their price drops significantly I still look into it. Perhaps the best antidote to overtrading is not to trade at all; <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/success/ct-biz-warren-buffett-index-funds-dollarsense-20190305-story.html\">Warren Buffet, the famed investor, advises against stock-picking</a>, and I agree with him; it’s the best alternative for the majority.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Have a hypotheses per position and do scenario planning</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Research is the most time-consuming part of stock-picking; having a hypothesis directs the research. For example when selling puts I expect a stock to stay above a price point by a certain date. To determine the price point I read the news, look at historical performance, and compare with peers. </p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Compete against self, not S&#x26;P 500 or an arbitrary target</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Goals on how much to generate, eg. generate 2% returns montly for a $20,000 account, are detrimental to long-term growth because they focus on short-term gains and ignore the context. Last year I was able to double an accounts; this year I don’t expect the same performance since the COVID impacted stock already turned around. I still look for stocks that are temporarily hampered, with long term growth potential.</p>\n<p>There you go, the truth, the fun, and the dangerous. Keep the day job and have fun learning about individual stocks, or go with an index fund and skip stock-picking altogether. The stock market is supposed to be boring and profitable, not a source of entertainment. </p>","fields":{"slug":"/ugly-investing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ugly truths in stock-picking"}},"next":{"html":"<p>During this last year, I spent much time indoors pondering what matters to me. Life happened despite the pandemic: I traveled and changed jobs as planned. I looked for a set of values behind these decisions to apply for future decision-making. Here’s what I came up with. </p>\n<h2>My values are:</h2>\n<p>Simplicity, Creativity, and Optimize for long-term happiness.</p>\n<h2>Why values matter</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>To provide a framework for <strong>decision-making</strong>: It’s good to have long-term criteria to base the decisions on</li>\n<li>For <strong>protection</strong>: everyone’s value is different and what feels right to others might feel wrong to you. Knowing your values helps to detect and avoid incompatible values.</li>\n<li>For <strong>happiness</strong>: working on what matters will make you happier. Dopamine, a happiness chemical, is <a href=\"https://www.edutopia.org/blog/neurologist-makes-case-video-game-model-learning-tool\">released on incremental progress</a>. It’s 100% legal and free.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How I came up with my values</h2>\n<p>I asked myself these questions:</p>\n<h3>1. What do I need the most in my life?</h3>\n<p>I need <strong>simplicity</strong>. My interests include <a href=\"../ugly-investing\">trading stocks</a> and starting a business, and both deal with complex systems. My job as a software engineer tackles complexity with complexity. I need simplicity to make sense of the world, and to reduce the cognitive load. This means renting instead of buying a house, making fewer trades on the stock market, and making sense of the world by creating.</p>\n<h3>2. Consume vs create</h3>\n<p>I’m a creative person: creating something, even jotting down thoughts, is an enjoyable activity. Consuming too much media, on the other hand, is draining. I consume content from a select few writers and artists. To avoid binging content, I create my own. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, after all.</p>\n<h3>3. Which type of happiness to optimize for</h3>\n<p>There are two types of happiness: <a href=\"https://www.trackinghappiness.com/short-term-long-term-happiness/\">long-term and short-term</a>. Short-term happiness leads to consumerism: eating a lot, drinking a lot, smoking whatnot. It includes buying unnecessary products: <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/retail-therapy-shopping-compulsion/\">retail therapy works</a>, but only short-term.</p>\n<p>Long-term happiness deals with <a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/delayed-gratification-why-wait-for-what-you-want-2795429\">delayed gratification</a>. It’s about minimizing the paycheque while maximizing the retirement account contributions, going to bed early instead of binge-watching YouTube, and exercising instead of window-shopping. It’s about working on personal projects at 6 am and 7 pm instead of binging content. I choose it because the payoff is greater.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Thanks to the pandemic I’ve had time to mull over major decisions. Three values stood out: simplicity, creativity, and long-term happiness. I use them daily for prioritization and planning.</p>\n<p>What are your top three values? And how are you living them?</p>","fields":{"slug":"/my_values/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My top 3 values"}}}}}
