During this past month I’ve improved at controlling my spend. I haven’t bought any clothing online for almost two weeks, and don’t feel the urge to buy now. Here are 8 tips to curb online spending.</p>\n<h3>1. Find a new hobby</h3>\n<p>My former hobby was buying upscale clothing at a reasonable price. Over time, snapping up deals depleted my bank account and overflowed my closet. Eventually I realized my research skills could be put to better use. Nowadays I develop mobile apps as a hobby, because I know the importance of a good user interface in getting people to do what you want. I will blog more on my <a href=\"../quotes-app\">first Android app, created with react-native</a>.</p>\n<h3>2. Try selling the items</h3>\n<p><em>I can always resell it</em> was one of my favorite excuses to justify a new purchase. To experience reselling I’ve started <a href=\"../shopping-experience\">selling items on Poshmark</a>, and surprise surprise, clothes are way more <em>difficult to sell</em> than imagined. The many factors at play include the season, fit, trendiness, … Nevertheless selling clothes online is a new hobby of mine, because it is much more intellectually challenging and satisfying than buying.</p>\n<h3>3. Work on your body instead</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/587506-when-i-was-sixteen-i-had-just-two-things-on\">Warren Buffet said: if you only had one car, you’d baby that car. The same thing can be said about your body</a>. We each have only one body, it is the foundation of every outfit, so we need to take care of it! To stay fit while staying inside I’ve resorted to eating baby carrots (they are sweet and filling) and doing an hour of cardio each day including jumping jacks and pushups. I love exercising right after a meal because exercise necessitates smaller and healthier meals. If you want to look good in any outfit, work that bod!</p>\n<h3>4. Journal why you want to buy that item</h3>\n<p>Put the pen to paper and dig deep. For me, I digged trench coats with leather sleeves. Why? Because it stood out and exerted authority. Knowing that I want to stand out and exert authority, I amassed technical skills to stand out, and volunteered for leadership positions to gain authority. This exercise is very elucidating and can be more rewarding than shopping. It’s also free!</p>\n<h3>5. Realize the carrying cost of each item</h3>\n<p>Owning an item is not just coughing up the purchase price. Over the duration of ownership there’s cleaning cost, tailoring cost, mending cost, and selling/donation cost. With a large overflowing closet, the amount quickly adds up. Hence a small closet is good for your wallet.</p>\n<h3>6. Donate half of your closet</h3>\n<p>Take a large garbage bag and fill it with unworn clothes, donate it, then revel in the reclaimed spaciousness. Donating items is the fastest way to declutter, and decluttering feels great because it lifts weight from your closet, mind, and wallet (see previous point).</p>\n<h3>7. Prioritize buying other things</h3>\n<p>What can you do with $125 extra per month? Instead of shopping you can save for a trip, or buy other items such as books. $125 worth of books gives greater joy than most $125 worth of clothing, and books have lower carrying cost. They don’t need dry cleaning, and are easier to gift than clothes :)</p>\n<h3>Give these tips a try!</h3>\n<p>These are the tips I’m working with, and they are working. Now when I see a desirable item I examine <em>why the item appeals</em> to me, then <em>prioritize</em> the item amongst what to purchase. This means less purchases and a less cluttered mind and closet. Try these tips and they can work for you too!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"8 tips to curb spending","date":"May 11, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/curb-online-spending/","previous":{"html":"<p>I’ve been part of <a href=\"https://www.toastmasters.org\">Toastmasters</a> since January 2014. I was an intern and joined the club to get a job. Instead of getting a job, I got bitten by the public speaking bug. During my third internship I joined <a href=\"https://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club/01488281-salesforce-toastmasters\">Salesforce Toastmasters</a>. The Toastmasters club was one of the reasons I returned to <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com\">Salesforce</a> upon graduation, and I was an active member there for 5 years. Overall I’ve been a Toastmaster member for 7+ years and served as a past President and current Division Director. Here are three ways on how Toastmasters has benefited my career.</p>\n<h3>Seek speaking opportunities at work</h3>\n<p>An experienced Toastmater is a confident speaker with a vast repertoire of speaking experiences. He/she has spoken at various settings, whether that is MCing an online contest, facilitating a panel, or delivering a workshop. Having done all of the above at Toastmasters, I’m confident delivering an experience on front of hundreds of coworkers, whether that is facilitating a panel, MCing a hackathon, or grabbing a 30 minute coffee with a new colleague. How does Toastmasters help with grabbing coffee with someone!? First, you are speaking with another person, so it is public speaking. Second, standard Toastmaster meetings have a section of <a href=\"https://www.toastmasters.org/membership/club-meeting-roles/table-topics-speaker\">Table Topics</a>, where you ask questions to get another person to talk for 1 to 2 minutes. Grabbing coffee is one of the many ways I seek speaking opportunities at work, and having Toastmasters experience gives me a boost of confidence.</p>\n<h3>Craft, tailor, and refine your message</h3>\n<p>After netting a speaking opportunity, what do you say? <strong>Crafting</strong> the message, like any skill, gets better with more practice. My first speech took 12 hours of preparation, now my prep time is &#x3C; 1 hour on many occasions. The message also needs to be <strong>tailored</strong> to the audience: at Salesforce Toastmasters the audience hungered for my personal finance talks, since tech professionals are interested in accumulating wealth. During the Toastmaster’s competition season, the topic turns to self-development to appeal to a wider demographic. Additionally Toastmasters members give feedback on how to <strong>refine</strong> the mesasge. This includes feedback on content, ie. I’m notorious for having too much content, and also the delivery, ie. replace filler words (umms, so’s) with pauses. I make sure I get feedback on my speeches, especially the speeches for work, to improve my speaking skills.</p>\n<h3>Seek leadership experience at work</h3>\n<p>I sought leadership opportunities at Toastmasters to deliver amazing experiences by enlisting the most accomplished, motivated Toastmaster members to be part of my initiatives. Here’s a sample of initiatives I delivered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organized, staffed, and delivered 3 trainings in one month, resulting in ~120 Toastmasters officers trained</li>\n<li>Organized, staffed, and delivered 2 online contests, one with 70+ attendance</li>\n<li>Was accountable for 25 clubs spanning ~700 Toastmaster members, by working with 4 area directors, each covering 5 clubs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these experiences I’ve ran hackathons at work, and this week I’m moderating a panel of coworkers. Because working with good people and delivering rewarding experiences has an exponentail effect on everyone involved. I’ve gone from a shy intern seeking a job to a confident professional seeking opportunities to assemble teams to deliver wonderful experiences. Any team initative is also a speaking opportunity, where I practice crafting, tailoring, and refining a message. Hence Toastmasters is fully applicable, and a great testing ground for communication and leadership skills.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/toastmasters-experience/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I grew my career through Toastmasters"}},"next":{"html":"<p>Since one of my guiding principles is <a href=\"../create-more-than-consume/\">to create more than I consume</a>, and I’ve been reading on my phone, I figured why not create a <em>mobile app to direct my reading</em>?\nSpecifically I wanted a <a href=\"https://github.com/annyh/quote-app-react-native\">quotes app</a> to save interesting quotes by interesting people. As for skill level, I’ve dipped my toes in <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/\">React Native</a> (a framework for developing native apps) a few weeks before, and have 5+ years of React and JavaScript experience. Here’s how I, a React Native newbie, designed and created a React Native app over one weekend.</p>\n<h3>Video walkthrough of the <a href=\"https://github.com/annyh/quote-app-react-native\">Quotes App</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e7yGb7OFbI\" title=\"Quote app\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/8e7yGb7OFbI/0.jpg\" alt=\"Quote app\"></a></p>\n<h3>1. Be clear about what the app does</h3>\n<p>For research I looked on Google Play to find quote-saving apps, and found them ad-filled and/or sharing-oriented. Instead I wanted a simple, ad-free interface to save interesting quotes by insteresting people. On Friday post dinner I sketched the app’s UI on a paper notebook, and the sketches set the tone for the development on Saturday.</p>\n<h3>2. Keep the UI simple</h3>\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://react-native-elements.github.io/react-native-elements/docs/overview.html\">react-native-elements</a> for the UI, including a ListView and ButtonGroup. For navigation I used <a href=\"https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/\">react-navigation’s bottom tabs</a> because tabs are faster to access than the collapsible sidebar.</p>\n<h3>3. Reuse code</h3>\n<p>To get quotes I used this <a href=\"https://goodquotesapi.herokuapp.com/#/developer\">Heroku app derived from Goodreads</a>. For data storage I used <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/asyncstorage.html\">AsyncStorage</a>, which stores data on the phone. <a href=\"https://dev.to/amanhimself/what-is-asyncstorage-in-react-native-4af4\">AsyncStorage has a 6MB limit</a> and it’s not a deal-breaker since I’m prototyping and storing short strings. I could have gone with <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/\">Firebase</a> or another database, but given the tight deadline, I reused the AsyncStorage save/delete code, mostly from <a href=\"https://github.com/mahmudahsan/todos-react-reactnative/tree/master/mobile/model\">this repo</a>. </p>\n<h3>4. Some UI decisions are made midway</h3>\n<p>Midway through Saturday I thought about and added a <strong>link to the authors’ Wikipedia page</strong>, since the URL structure is predictable for most English authors. This makes the authors’ backgrounds easy to access. Additionally I noticed how taxing it is for the user to come up with a new search for quotes. So I added the search by <strong>random tag</strong> feature. The <strong>random tag</strong> is one of <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/career/documents/my-career-path-activities/values-exercise.pdf\">100 possible values</a>. Randomization lowers the barriers to discover more interesting quotes.</p>\n<h3>5. Track to dos to work briskly</h3>\n<p>I jot down development tasks in the <a href=\"https://github.com/annyh/quote-app-react-native/blob/master/readme.md#todo\">readme.md</a> so I can pick up where I left off. Also typing out the tasks clarifies the steps for progress.</p>\n<h3>That’s a wrap!</h3>\n<p>It was a productive weekend, with enough time leftover to take <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e7yGb7OFbI\">a video</a> and write up this blog post. The <a href=\"https://github.com/annyh/quote-app-react-native\">source code is here</a>. It still has <a href=\"https://github.com/annyh/quote-app-react-native/blob/master/readme.md#todo\">some to dos</a>, so I can pick it up during the week, or another weekend :)</p>","fields":{"slug":"/first-react-native-app/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Creating a React Native app over a weekend"}}}}}
