It was a proper novel with a beginning, a middle, and an end. I first attempted Nanowrimo in 9th grade, and came away with a Frankenstein monster of plot, backstory, and ramblings. This year I learned enough about novel writing to fill a blog post worth revisiting. </p>\n<p>Here’s what I learned from a productive Nanowrimo.</p>\n<h3>1. Define success: you can lose the battle and still win the war</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://nanowrimo.org/\">Nanowrimo</a> was the battle; it was the goal of hitting 50,000 words. The war was to finish the first draft of a novel. I read novels voraciously as a child and found them to be just a bit off, enough for me to think I could write a better one.\nThis year I wrote 40,000 words on November 30th and finished a novel of 90,929 words by December 30th. Differentiating between the short and long term goal, and which one was more important, was the key to success.</p>\n<h3>2. Only the story counts towards progress</h3>\n<p>Writing a novel means writing a story. The research and backstory filled up many pages, but they were not the story. Only the story is the story. Consequently the only way to start a story is to start a story. While backstory and character backgrounds are important, they can begin after Chapter One.</p>\n<h3>3. Minimize the research</h3>\n<p>My book featured a detective, so I read up on cop biographies. It was highly valuable to read San Francisco Police Department’s Sergeant Adam Platinga’s books, <a href=\"https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3661412093\">Police Craft</a> and <a href=\"https://sfpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/2934801093\">400 Things Cops Know</a>. While the books provided great insight, in hindsight I didn’t have to read them page to page to write about a detective. What I needed to know was what went inside a police car, which was a Google search away, and the process to arrest a murder suspect, also a Google search away. I’ve also spent a hundred hours researching officer deaths, serial killers, and bomb threats for my thriller. Those hours were better spent writing.</p>\n<h3>4. Have a daily progress goal</h3>\n<p>My daily goal was 4 chapters; if I wrote 4 chapters I would be happy. Each chapter was 1 to 2 pages. Some days I wrote 3 chapters and others I wrote 8. Chapters were a mini story arc; they had a beginning, a middle, and an end. Chapters were a better barometer of progress than the plain wordcount.  </p>\n<h3>5. Work in bursts</h3>\n<p>I wrote in 30 minute bursts. After 30 minutes if I’m distracted I move around to get the blood flowing. Working in bursts helped me to stay focused. They also measured effort: each chapter took 3 to 5 bursts. One burst was to outline the chapter, which may be several sentences. The middle bursts fleshed out the chapter, ie. adding description and dialogue. Then it took another burst to tighten up the writing, ensure flow, etc. </p>\n<h3>6. Find someone to read your work</h3>\n<p>I wrote the novel during the COVID-19 epidemic while self-isolating at home with my significant other. He was a good sport and read the first draft, using different voices to bring the story to life. He also gave feedback on what worked and what did not. As a bonus he cajoled me to finish the draft when I took a week-long break. Having direct feedback improved the story’s quality, and made writing less lonely. </p>\n<h3>7. Focus on the main character</h3>\n<p>The main character can make or break the story. My main character was not likable, but he grew on me after undergoing much trial and tribulation. I was so impressed by his dedication that I changed the ending. He’s among the main reasons that I finished the book, because I (and my significant other) wanted to find out what he did next.</p>\n<h3>8. Focus on one book at a time</h3>\n<p>I wrote flash fiction and blog posts before I started on the novel. During the novel I was tempted to start shorter works, but told myself to focus. The focus paid off; whatever I wrote fed to the novel, so I was able to output 3 chapters per day on average.</p>\n<p>These are the tips that worked for me, after much trial and tribulation. I posted them as a refresher for the future me.\nTry them out! They may work for you too.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"8 tips for a successful nanowrimo","date":"December 30, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/nanowrimo-2020/","previous":{"html":"<p>America’s birthday was a sunny day in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>Boyfriend and I came out of our apartment by the bay, our empty stomachs grumbling. The noontime sun bared down at us. We inched towards the Ferry building. </p>\n<p>At the building we got Japanese food: miso soup and curry beef. Yes we ate Asian food on America’s birthday; the city’s culinary options abound. On this day people crowded along the water. We ate on the benches with the dishes on our laps, our heads bent like monks in prayer.</p>\n<p>We headed towards Pier 39 along the Embarcadero street. A dozen nude male cyclists stood around the corner, sunbathing in helmets, shoes, and sunscreen. They smiled and basked in their sunlit glory. I ogled through my sunglasses, happy with the happenstance.</p>\n<p>Along the Embarcadero Harley Davidsons roared; black, orange, and green ones flew by. Their riders sat low; their hair floated like Beyonce’s.</p>\n<p>At Pier 39 the sea lions were missing. Boyfriend googled their whereabouts; during July they were away breeding. I miss their loud and smelly presence and yearn for their return.</p>\n<p>Throughout the afternoon we heard fireworks, and the drama intensified when the evening came. The fireworks streaked the sky, splattering yellow, green, and red on the dark canvas. We enjoyed the sights. Our furry friends lost the control over their bowels.</p>\n<p>T’was a glorious day in the city by the bay. </p>\n<p>Happy birthday America.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/july-fourth/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"July 4th in San Francisco"}},"next":null}}}
