title: Best Investing Blogs

There are many blogs on investing. These are the most beginner-friendly ones.

**Compounding Snowballs** [Why do I invest](http://compoundingsnowballs.blogspot.com/2017/06/why-do-i-invest.html) 


I found about Maya Peterson from reading Barron's, where her book on investing for teenagers was mentioned. According to her profile, Maya began her investing journey at age nine. I wish I started that young. This favorite blog post answers a popular question: "why invest, when you can work for money"?

**Dilbert** [Diversification](http://blog.dilbert.com/2008/10/15/diversification/)

This is a comic blog, but when Dilbert's author Scott Adams shares investment advice, I listen. His tips? First,stay away from fee-based asset manageers. Then buy into a sinking stock market, because "this is either the beginning of the end of the United States as we know it, in which case it doesn’t matter how I invested, or it is a once-in-a-lifetime stock buying opportunity."
