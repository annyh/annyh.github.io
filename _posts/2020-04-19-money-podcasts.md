title: Year-long Shopping ban, from 4/2020 to 4/2021
tags: personal shopping

After several years of emotional shopping I need a break. Thanks to sites like [thredup](https://www.thredup.com/), [poshmark](https://poshmark.com), and [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/), I spent countless hours browsing online, resulting in overflowing closets, mindless spending, and less savings. Why is less savings troubling? A dollar invested today, assuming a 7% growth rate, [will double in 10 years](http://www.moneychimp.com/features/rule72.htm).
Inspired by the [shopping ban by Cate Flanders](https://caitflanders.com/shopping-ban/), I need a shopping ban for myself, with custom rules.

### The Rules
For simplicity there are two buckets of spending: one is banned, another not banned.

##### Banned categories:
- **clothing**: it feels bad spending good money on emotional purchases, meaning purchases made when I felt lonely, homesick, or bored. Instead of shopping for clothes I will call my parents and forge stronger relationships. Additionally I will use the saved time to develop programming and drawing skills, and investing knowledge
- **art supplies**: After a buying-spree on colored markers, I'm good for a few years
- **online courses**: I've considered paying for [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com) for drawing courses and [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) for technical knowledge, however their free content is sufficient. I use [LinkedIn Learning, it is free with my library membership](https://sfpl.org/research-learn/elearning); LinkedIn Learning has good courses on technology and personal finance. Additionally I already have an annual subscription for [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), and they specialize in Python and Data Science. 

##### Categories outside the ban:
- **food**: my monthly expenditure is already low
- **travel**: my budget is already < $1000/year
- **books**: I have a soft spot for buying used books. I read 80% of the books I buy, and on average they cost < $10 each

Looking forward to a year of less spending, less clutter, and more savings!
