title: Do habit tracking apps help maintain habits?

It seems too good to be true: does tracking habits on an app increase the likelihood to stick to the habit?
I've tried using two apps, and so far the response has been yes!

### What is a habit app?
These apps are truly simple: define the minimum viable habit dose, and tap on the calendar when you've accomplished enough of it for that day. Here's the UI for [Habit Bull](http://www.habitbull.com), my first habit app. It was free but I gave up after it asked to upgrade to add a 6th goal. As you can see I have stuck better with some habits, such as drawing and exercising.

### Current habit app

I've switched to use [Loop Habit Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&hl=en_US), which also has a clean interface. It allows for more goals to be tracked and is also free!

### Motivation behind my goals

I'm curious about people's goals and the motivations behind them, so here are the motivations behind the current goals. Making progress on these gives me joy and a feeling of control, even though we live under the shadow of an epidemic.

1. **Drawing**: practicing to draw faster to create comics. Also, just maybe, I can be more prolific than I was in high school. I was [a wonderful artist, here's proof](https://www.behance.net/annyhe)
2. **Exercise**: Nothing feels as good as doing jumping jacks while listening to the latest pop music. I feel and look better after exercising
3. **Journal 6 pages**: someone said the *unexamined life is not worth living*. I journal to dig deeper to understand what I'm feeling, and which next steps fit best into my long term goals
4. **Publish a new blog post**: I feel better *producing* content than *consuming* content. Nowadays consuming is far too easy, and when I overdo it ie. listen to money podcasts for hours it hurts my head. Also defining and declaring my intentions decompresses me
5. **Not buy clothe**s: I'm trying to keep it for 1 year. I have too much clothes after many emotinoal purchases on [Poshmark](https://poshmark.com) and [eBay](ebay.com). Good news: making progress on my other goals keeps this one afloat, because the more time I spend elsewhere, the less time I spend shopping :)
6. **Work 30 minutes on a money producing side hustle**: I've sold shoes on [Poshmark](https://poshmark.com) and [theRealReal](https://www.therealreal.com). Always looking for additional revenue streams
7. **16/8 fasting**: eat for 8 hours then not eat for 16 hours. It delays the next grocery shop visit, given [San Francisco has a shelter-in-place policy](https://sf.gov/stay-home-except-essential-needs). Since I'm cooped up 24/7 this is easier now than before

I plan to add more habits to **ladder** them, and plan to stick with them for at least 66 days, which is [how long it takes for a new habit to stick](https://jamesclear.com/new-habit).
