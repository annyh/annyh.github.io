title: How Toastmasters has benefited my career
tags: personal career
---

I've been part of [Toastmasters](https://www.toastmasters.org) since January 2014. I was an intern and joined the club to get a job. Instead of getting a job, I got bitten by the public speaking bug. During my third internship I joined [Salesforce Toastmasters](https://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club/01488281-salesforce-toastmasters). The Toastmasters club was one of the reasons I returned to [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com) upon graduation, and I was an active member there for 5 years. Overall I've been a Toastmaster member for 7+ years and served as a past President and current Division Director. Here are three ways on how Toastmasters has benefited my career.

### Seek speaking opportunities at work
An experienced Toastmater is a confident speaker with a vast repertoire of speaking experiences. He/she has spoken at various settings, whether that is MCing an online contest, facilitating a panel, or delivering a workshop. Having done all of the above at Toastmasters, I'm confident delivering an experience on front of hundreds of coworkers, whether that is facilitating a panel, MCing a hackathon, or grabbing a 30 minute coffee with a new colleague. How does Toastmasters help with grabbing coffee with someone!? First, you are speaking with another person, so it is public speaking. Second, standard Toastmaster meetings have a section of [Table Topics](https://www.toastmasters.org/membership/club-meeting-roles/table-topics-speaker), where you ask questions to get another person to talk for 1 to 2 minutes. Grabbing coffee is one of the many ways I seek speaking opportunities at work, and having Toastmasters experience gives me a boost of confidence.

### Craft, tailor, and refine your message
After netting a speaking opportunity, what do you say? **Crafting** the message, like any skill, gets better with more practice. My first speech took 12 hours of preparation, now my prep time is < 1 hour on many occasions. The message also needs to be **tailored** to the audience: at Salesforce Toastmasters the audience hungered for my personal finance talks, since tech professionals are interested in accumulating wealth. During the Toastmaster's competition season, the topic turns to self-development to appeal to a wider demographic. Additionally Toastmasters members give feedback on how to **refine** the mesasge. This includes feedback on content, ie. I'm notorious for having too much content, and also the delivery, ie. replace filler words (umms, so's) with pauses. I make sure I get feedback on my speeches, especially the speeches for work, to improve my speaking skills.

### Seek leadership experience at work
I sought leadership opportunities at Toastmasters to deliver amazing experiences by enlisting the most accomplished, motivated Toastmaster members to be part of my initiatives. Here's a sample of initiatives I delivered:
- Organized, staffed, and delivered 3 trainings in one month, resulting in ~120 Toastmasters officers trained
- Organized, staffed, and delivered 2 online contests, one with 70+ attendance
- Oversee 25 clubs spanning ~700 Toastmaster members, by working with 4 area directors, each covering 5 clubs

With these experiences I've ran hackathons at work, and this week I'm moderating a panel of coworkers. Because working with good people and delivering rewarding experiences has an exponentail effect on everyone involved. I've gone from a shy intern seeking a job to a confident professional seeking opportunities to assemble teams to deliver wonderful experiences. Any team initative is also a speaking opportunity, where I practice crafting, tailoring, and refining a message. Hence Toastmasters is fully applicable, and a great testing ground for communication and leadership skills.
