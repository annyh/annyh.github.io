Did you actually play the bagpipes?

Yes I did. For 7 years. This is a video me playing the Canadian anthem on the bagpipes.

Here is another video of me playing Amazing Grace with the wonderful Simon Fraser University Pipe Band.

Why am I writing this blog?
=
After several on-off attempts to blog, I revived this blog during the Christmas break in 2017, after my grandfather passed away.
If my grandfather had a blog, I can learn more about him even after he passed away. Perhaps I should chronicle my life too. That way if people are curious, they can reach at least a part of me.

A less sentimental reason is to have a repository of well-chronicled answers to the usual questions people ask me about. They are often regarding investing, drawing (as in fine arts), or software engineering. It is pragmatic to point people to articles instead of trying to regurgitate the main points within 5 minutes. 



Who is Anny?

Anny was an artist and former bagpiper turned business student. She was also trilingual at age of 12, having lived on three continents (Asia, Europe, and Canada). Now she is bilingual and works as a software engineer.

She has an insatiable apetite for self-improvement, and interest in the following fields:
- investing: how to make the money work for you
- software engineering: and its intersection with product management
- comics: how to leverage the medium to make learning entertaining and fun
